1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,640
george hotz a.k.a

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,599
geohot his second time on the podcast

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,679
he's the founder of comma ai an

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,880
autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,080
technology company

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,039
that seeks to be to tesla autopilot what

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,080
android is

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,920
to the ios they sell the

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,840
comma two device for one thousand

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
dollars that when installed

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
in many of their supported cars can keep

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,880
the vehicle centered in the lane

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,519
even when there are no lane markings it

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,440
includes

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,600
driver sensing that ensures that the

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,520
driver's eyes are on the road

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,079
as you may know i'm a big fan of driver

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,640
sensing i do believe tesla autopilot and

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
others

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
should definitely include it in their

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
sensor suite also

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,239
i'm a fan of android and a big fan of

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
george for many reasons

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,680
including his non-linear out of the box

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
brilliance

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,039
and the fact that he's a superstar

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,360
programmer

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,160
of a very different style than myself

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,280
styles make

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,520
fights and styles make conversations so

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,440
i

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
really enjoyed this chat i'm sure we'll

34
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,920
talk many more times on this podcast

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,159
quick mention of each sponsor followed

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,880
by some thoughts related to the episode

37
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,680
first is four sigmatic the maker of

38
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
delicious

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,439
mushroom coffee second is the coding

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
that i listen to

note

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,479
let me say that my work at mit on

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles

52
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,680
led me to study the human side of

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
autonomy enough

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,680
to understand that it's a beautifully

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
complicated and interesting problem

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
space

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
much richer than what can be studied in

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
the lab

59
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
in that sense the data that comma ai

60
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,119
tesla autopilot

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,479
and perhaps others like cadillac super

62
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,799
crews are collecting

63
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,159
gives us a chance to understand how we

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,640
can design safe

65
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,439
semiautonomous vehicles for real human

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
beings

67
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,920
in real world conditions i think this

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
requires bold innovation

69
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,319
and a serious exploration of the first

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
principles of the driving task

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840

and now here's my conversation with

78
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,800
george

79
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
hotz so last time we started talking

80
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,920
about the simulation

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
this time let me ask you do you think

82
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,400
there's intelligent life out there in

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,560
the universe

84
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,720
i've always maintained my answer to the

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,800
fermi paradox i think there

86
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,760
has been intelligent life elsewhere in

87
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,760
the universe

88
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,440
so the intelligent civilizations existed

89
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,160
but they've blown themselves up so your

90
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
general intuition is that intelligent

91
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,840
civilizations quickly like there's that

92
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
parameter

93
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,519
in in the drake equation your senses

94
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,920
they don't last very long

95
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
yeah how are we doing on that like have

96
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,000
we lasted pretty

97
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,040
pretty good i don't know we do oh yeah

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,599
i mean not quite yet

99
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,920
well what telly has your caskey the iq

100
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,360
required to destroy the world falls by

101
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,720
one point every year

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,440
okay so technology democratizes

103
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,319
the destruction of the world when can a

104
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,319
meme destroy the world

105
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,400
it kind of is already right somewhat

106
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,080
i don't think i don't think we've seen

107
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
anywhere near the worst of it yet

108
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,319
world's going to get weird well maybe a

109
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
mu can save the world

110
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
you thought about that the meme lord

111
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,920
elon musk fighting on the side of good

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,400
versus the uh the meme lord of the

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,159
darkness which is uh not saying anything

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,879
bad about donald trump

115
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,640
but he is the the lord of the meme on

116
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
the dark side he's a darth vader of

117
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,200
memes

118
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,799
i think in every fairy tale

119
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,400
they always end it with and they lived

120
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,920
happily ever after and i'm like please

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
tell me more about this happily ever

122
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
after i've heard

123
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,519
50 percent of marriages end in divorce

124
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
uh why doesn't your marriage end up

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,159
there you can't just say happily ever

126
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,560
after so

127
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,480
it's the thing about destruction is it's

128
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
over after the destruction

129
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
um we have to do everything right in

130
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,199
order to avoid it

131
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
and uh one thing wrong i mean actually

132
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,880
that's what i really like about

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
cryptography

134
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
cryptography it seems like we live in a

135
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,680
world where the defense wins

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
um versus like nuclear weapons the

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
opposite is true

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
it is much easier to build a warhead

139
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,840
that splits into 100 little warheads

140
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,800
than to build something that can

141
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,800
you know take out 100 little warheads uh

142
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,160
the offense has the advantage there

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,199
um so maybe our future is in crypto but

144
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
uh so cryptography right the goliath is

145
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
the

146
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,520
the defense and then all the different

147
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,639
hackers

148
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,680
are the uh are the davids and that

149
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,600
equation is flipped for nuclear war

150
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
because there's so many like one nuclear

151
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
weapon destroys everything

152
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
essentially yeah and it is much easier

153
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,199
to uh

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,039
attack with a nuclear weapon than it is

155
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,080
to like the technology required to

156
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,000
intercept and destroy

157
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
a rocket is much more complicated than

158
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
the technology required to just you know

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
orbital trajectory send a rocket to

160
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,919
somebody

161
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
so okay your intuition that the there

162
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,840
were intelligent

163
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,720
civilizations out there but it's very

164
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,880
possible that they're

165
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
no longer there that's kind of a sad

166
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,759
picture they

167
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,280
enter some steady state they all

168
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
wirehead themselves

169
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,000
what's wirehead um stimulate stimulate

170
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,919
their pleasure centers

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,759
uh and just you know live forever in

172
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,960
this kind of stasis

173
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,400
they become well i mean i think the

174
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,240
reason i believe this is because where

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,039
are they

176
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,479
if there's some reason they stopped

177
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,440
expanding

178
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,560
because otherwise they would have taken

179
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,080
over the universe the universe isn't

180
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,080
that big or at least you know

181
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,160
let's just talk about the galaxy right

182
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
70 000 light years across

183
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,039
uh i took that number from star trek

184
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
voyager i don't know how true it is but

185
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,280
um

186
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,240
uh yeah that's not big right 70

187
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,919
000 light years is nothing for some

188
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
possible technology that you can imagine

189
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,319
that could leverage like wormholes or

190
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
something like that

191
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,520
you don't even need wormholes just a von

192
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,120
neumann probe is enough a von

193
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
neumann probe and a million years of

194
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,319
sublight travel and you'd have taken

195
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
over the whole universe

196
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,840
that clearly uh didn't happen so

197
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,080
something stopped it

198
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
so you mean if you right for for like a

199
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,759
few million years

200
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
if you sent out probes that travel close

201
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,160
what's sublight

202
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
meaning close to the speed of light

203
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,919
let's it just spreads

204
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
interesting actually that's an

205
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,240
interesting calculation

206
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
huh so what makes you think that would

207
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,360
be able to uh communicate with them

208
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,680
like uh yeah what what's

209
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,880
why do you think we would able to be

210
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,759
able to comprehend

211
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,160
intelligent lives that are out there

212
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
like

213
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
even if they were among us kind of thing

214
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,880
like

215
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,080
or even just flying around well

216
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
i mean that's possible it's possible

217
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
that there is some sort of prime

218
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
directive

219
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,840
uh that'd be a really cool universe to

220
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,599
live in um and there's some reason

221
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
they're not making themselves visible to

222
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,440
us

223
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,039
but it makes sense that they would use

224
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,120
the same

225
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,639
well at least the same entropy well

226
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
you're implying the same laws of physics

227
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,400
i don't know what you mean by entropy

228
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,880
in this case oh yeah i mean if entropy

229
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,479
is the scarce resource in the universe

230
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,720
so what do you think about like stephen

231
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,039
wolfram and everything is a computation

232
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,039
and then what if they are traveling

233
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,639
through this world of computation so

234
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,560
if you think of the universe as just

235
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,360
information processing

236
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
then uh what you're referring to with

237
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
with entropy

238
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
and then these these pockets of

239
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,360
interesting complex computations

240
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
swimming around

241
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,800
how do we know they're not already here

242
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
how do we know that this like all the

243
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
different

244
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
amazing things that are full of mystery

245
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,919
on earth

246
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
are just like little footprints of

247
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,280
intelligence from

248
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,199
light years away maybe i mean

249
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,440
i tend to think that as civilizations

250
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,879
expand they use more and more energy

251
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,879
uh and you can never overcome the

252
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,759
problem of waste heat so where is their

253
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,120
waste heat

254
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,039
so we'd be able to with our crude

255
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,280
methods be able to see like there's a

256
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,919
whole lot of

257
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,440
energy here but it could be something

258
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,360
we're not i mean we don't understand

259
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,639
dark energy right dark matter

260
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
it could be just stuff we don't

261
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,960
understand at all or they could have a

262
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
fundamentally different physics

263
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,039
you know like that that we just don't

264
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,560
even compromise well i think

265
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,240
okay i mean it depends how far out you

266
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,519
want to go i don't think physics is very

267
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
different on the other side of the

268
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,240
galaxy

269
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,039
i would suspect that they have i mean if

270
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,760
they're in our

271
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,440
universe they have the same physics well

272
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,519
yeah that's the assumption we have

273
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,760
but there could be like super trippy

274
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,800
things like

275
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,440
like our cognition

276
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,279
only gets to a slice oh and all the

277
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
possible instruments that we can design

278
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
only get to a particular slice of the

279
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,120
universe and there's something much

280
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
like weirder maybe we can try a thought

281
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,920
experiment

282
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,760
um would people from the past

283
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
be able to detect the remnants of our

284
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,200
uh we would be able to detect our modern

285
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,640
civilization i think the answer is

286
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
obviously yes

287
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,480
you mean past from 100 years ago well

288
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
let's even go back further let's go to a

289
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
million years ago

290
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
right the humans who were lying around

291
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,200
in the desert probably didn't even have

292
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,519
maybe they just barely had fire uh

293
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,519
they would understand if a 747 flew

294
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,519
overhead

295
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:43,040
in in in this vicinity but not um

296
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,959
if the if a 747 flew on mars

297
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,320
because they wouldn't be able to see far

298
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,120
because we're not actually communicating

299
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,959
that well

300
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,200
with the rest of the universe we're

301
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
doing okay we're just sending out random

302
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,120
like

303
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,200
50s tracks of music true

304
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,120
and yeah i mean they'd have to you know

305
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
the we've only been broadcasting radio

306
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,839
waves for

307
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,560
um 150 years and well there's your light

308
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,920
cone

309
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,640
so yeah okay what do you make about all

310
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,160
the

311
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
i recently came across this uh having

312
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,760
talked to

313
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
david fravor i don't know if you caught

314
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,360
what the

315
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,760
the videos that pentagon released and

316
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,440
uh the new york times reporting of the

317
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,440
ufo sightings

318
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,120
so i kind of looked into it quote

319
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
unquote and

320
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,959
there's actually been like

321
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,760
hundreds of thousands of ufo sightings

322
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,000
right

323
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
and a lot of it you can explain away in

324
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,640
different kinds of ways

325
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,079
so one is it could be interesting

326
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,040
physical phenomena

327
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,480
two it could be people wanting to

328
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,079
believe

329
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,519
and therefore they conjure up a lot of

330
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,040
different things that just you know when

331
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
you see different kinds of lights some

332
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,760
basic physics phenomena

333
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,560
and then you just conjure up ideas of

334
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,839
possible

335
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,760
out there mysterious worlds but you know

336
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
it's also possible like you have a case

337
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,079
of

338
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,279
david fravor who is a navy pilot

339
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,240
who's you know as legit as a guest in

340
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,839
terms of

341
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,640
humans who are able to perceive

342
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,240
things in the environment and make

343
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,519
conclusions whether those things are a

344
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,279
threat or not

345
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,720
and he and several other pilots saw

346
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,279
a thing i don't know if you followed

347
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,120
this but they saw a thing that they've

348
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,360
since then called tick tock that moved

349
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,560
in all kinds of weird ways

350
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,600
they don't know what it is it could be

351
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,480
technology developed by by the united

352
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
states

353
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,000
and they're just not aware of it and the

354
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
surface level from the navy right it

355
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
could be

356
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,880
different kind of lighting technology or

357
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,000
drone technology all that kind of stuff

358
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,920
it could be the russians and then

359
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,279
chinese all that kind of stuff

360
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,079
and of course their mind our mind

361
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,240
can also venture into the possibility

362
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,399
that it's from another world

363
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,519
have you looked into this at all what do

364
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,040
you think about it

365
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,399
i think all the news is a psyop

366
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,720
i think that the most closing is real

367
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,399
yeah i listened to the uh i think it was

368
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,000
bob lazar

369
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,320
um on joe rogan and like i believe

370
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,680
everything this guy is saying and then i

371
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
think that it's probably just some like

372
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,360
mk ultra kind of thing you know

373
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,720
uh what do you mean like they they uh

374
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,160
you know they made some weird thing and

375
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,440
they called it an alien spaceship you

376
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
know maybe it was just to like

377
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
stimulate young physicist minds we'll

378
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,519
tell them it's alien technology and

379
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,279
we'll see what they come up with right

380
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,200
do you find any conspiracy theories

381
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,399
compelling like have you

382
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,320
pulled at the string of the of the rich

383
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,760
complex world of conspiracy theories

384
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
that's out there

385
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,440
i think that uh i've heard a conspiracy

386
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,880
theory that conspiracy theories were

387
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,639
invented by the cia

388
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:57,360
in the 60s to discredit true things yeah

389
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,160
um so you know you can go to ridiculous

390
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,959
conspiracy theories like flat earth and

391
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,800
pizzagate

392
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,160
and uh you know these things are almost

393
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,079
to hide like

394
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,519
conspiracy theories that like you know

395
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,200
remember when the chinese like locked up

396
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,639
the doctors who discovered coronavirus

397
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
like i tell people this and i'm like

398
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
no no that's not a conspiracy theory

399
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
that actually happened

400
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,720
do you remember the time that the money

401
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,560
used to be backed by gold and now it's

402
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,399
backed by nothing this is not a

403
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,519
conspiracy theory this actually

404
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,440
happened that's one of my worries

405
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,839
today with the idea of fake news is that

406
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,480
when nothing is real

407
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,000
then like you dilute the possibility of

408
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
anything being true by

409
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,920
conjuring up all kinds of conspiracy

410
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
theories and then you don't know what to

411
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,399
believe and then

412
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,680
like the idea of truth of objectivity is

413
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,880
lost completely

414
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,880
everybody has their own truth so you

415
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,440
used to control information by censoring

416
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
it

417
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800
then the internet happened and

418
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
governments are like oh we can't

419
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,360
censor things anymore

420
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
i know what we'll do you know it's the

421
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
old story

422
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,160
of uh the story of like tying a flag

423
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,959
where the leprechaun tells you the gold

424
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
is buried

425
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,920
and you tie one flag and you make the

426
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
leprechaun swear to not remove the flag

427
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,160
and you come back to the field later

428
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
with a shovel and there's flags

429
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,240
everywhere

430
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,160
that's one way to maintain privacy right

431
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,480
is like

432
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,399
in order to protect the contents of this

433
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
conversation for example we could just

434
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,440
generate like millions of deep fake

435
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,440
conversations where you and i talk

436
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,199
and say random things yeah so this is

437
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,560
just one of them and nobody knows which

438
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,320
one was the real one

439
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,120
this this could be fake right now

440
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,959
classic steganography technique

441
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,040
okay another absurd question about

442
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,040
intelligent life because uh

443
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,720
you know you're you're an incredible

444
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,480
programmer outside of everything else

445
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,639
we'll talk about just as a programmer

446
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,000
uh do you think intelligent beings out

447
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,480
there the civilizations that were out

448
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,240
there

449
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,800
had computers and programming

450
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,680
did they do we naturally have to develop

451
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,959
something where we engineer machines

452
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,199
and are able to encode both

453
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,399
knowledge into those machines and

454
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,240
instructions that

455
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,320
process that knowledge process that

456
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,600
information to to make decisions and

457
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,399
actions and so on

458
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,240
and with those programming languages if

459
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,000
you think they exist

460
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
be at all similar to anything we've

461
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,560
developed

462
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,839
so i don't see that much of a difference

463
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
between

464
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,399
quote-unquote natural languages and

465
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,399
programming languages

466
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,839
um yeah i think there's so many

467
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,480
similarities so

468
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,160
when asked the question what do alien

469
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,480
languages look like

470
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,399
i imagine they're not all that

471
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,720
dissimilar from ours

472
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,160
and i think translating in and out of

473
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,040
them

474
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,560
uh wouldn't be that crazy well it's

475
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,800
difficult to compile

476
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,800
like dna to python and then to see

477
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,839
i mean there is a little bit of a gap in

478
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,360
in the kind of languages we use for

479
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,160
for uh touring machines and the kind of

480
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,399
languages

481
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,519
nature seems to use a little bit maybe

482
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,680
that's just

483
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,360
we just haven't cr we haven't understood

484
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,759
the kind of language that nature uses

485
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,959
well

486
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,199
yet dna is a cad model

487
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,800
it's not quite a programming language it

488
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,360
has no sort of

489
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,000
serial execution it's not quite a

490
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
yeah it's a cad model um so i think in

491
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
that sense

492
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,360
we actually completely understand it the

493
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,360
problem is um you know

494
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
well simulating on these cad models i

495
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,120
played with it a bit this year

496
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
is super uh computationally intensive if

497
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,279
you want to go down to like the

498
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,120
molecular level

499
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,519
um where you need to go to see a lot of

500
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,720
these phenomena like protein folding

501
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,160
um so yeah it's not that it's it's not

502
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
it's not that we don't understand it it

503
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,839
just requires a whole lot of compute to

504
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,079
kind of

505
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,000
compile it for our human minds it's

506
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,759
inefficient both for the pro

507
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,680
for the data representation and for the

508
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,639
programming yeah it runs well on raw

509
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
nature

510
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,079
it runs well in raw nature and when we

511
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,880
try to build uh emulators or simulators

512
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,280
for that

513
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,480
uh well then manslaughter and i've tried

514
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,439
it

515
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,079
it runs in yeah you've commented

516
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,439
elsewhere

517
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,760
i don't remember where that uh

518
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,280
one of the problems is simulating nature

519
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,360
is tough

520
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,439
and if you want to sort of deploy a

521
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,120
prototype

522
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,360
i forgot how you you put it but it made

523
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,600
me laugh but animals or humans would

524
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,960
need to be involved

525
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,000
in order to in order to try to run some

526
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,440
prototype code on um

527
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,120
like if we're talking about covid and

528
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
viruses and so on yeah

529
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,880
if you were trying to engineer some kind

530
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,480
of defense mechanisms

531
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,960
like a vaccine uh against coven or

532
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,559
all that kind of stuff that doing any

533
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,320
kind of experimentation like you can

534
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
with like autonomous vehicles would be

535
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,240
very

536
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,799
technically cost technically and

537
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,320
ethically costly i'm not sure about that

538
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,120
i think you can do tons of

539
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
uh crazy biology and in test tubes i

540
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,640
think

541
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,360
my bigger complaint is more all the

542
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,360
tools are so bad

543
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,919
like literally you mean like like i'm

544
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,360
not libraries and i'm not pipetting

545
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,480
like you're handing me a i gotta no no

546
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,919
no no there has to be some

547
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,400
like automating stuff and like the

548
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,760
yeah but human biology is messy like it

549
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
seems like

550
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
look at those toronto's videos they were

551
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,720
a joke it's like it's like a little

552
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,559
gantry it's like a little xy gantry high

553
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,679
school science project with the pipette

554
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,280
i'm like

555
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,440
really gotta be something better you

556
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,600
can't build like nice microfluidics and

557
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,520
i can program the you know

558
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,039
computation to bio interface i mean this

559
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,919
is going to happen

560
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,880
but like right now if you are asking me

561
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,320
to pipette

562
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,760
50 milliliters of solution amount

563
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,600
this is so crude yeah okay

564
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,160
let's get all the crazy out of the way

565
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
uh so a bunch of people ask me

566
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,000
since we talked about the simulation

567
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,799
last time we talked about hacking the

568
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,840
simulation

569
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,480
do you have any updates any insights

570
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,200
about how we might be able to go about

571
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
hacking simulation if we indeed do live

572
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
in a simulation

573
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,320
i think a lot of people misinterpreted

574
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,840
the point of that south by talk

575
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,080
the point of the south by talk was not

576
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,440
literally to hack the simulation

577
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,440
uh i think that this

578
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,720
we this is this is an idea is literally

579
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,559
just i think theoretical physics i think

580
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,600
that's the whole

581
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,280
you know the whole goal

582
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,880
right you want your grand unified theory

583
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,480
but then okay build a brand new five

584
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
theory search for exploits

585
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,600
right i think we're nowhere near

586
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,880
actually there yet

587
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,880
my hope with that was just more to like

588
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,880
like are you people kidding me with the

589
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,880
things you spend time thinking about

590
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,919
do you understand like kind of how small

591
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,360
you are

592
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,440
you are you are bites and god's computer

593
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,280
really and the things that people get

594
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,360
worked up about and

595
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,120
you know so basically it was more

596
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,480
a message of uh we should humble

597
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,640
ourselves

598
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,520
that we we get to uh like what

599
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,559
what are we humans in this bite code

600
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
yeah

601
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,159
and not just just humble ourselves but

602
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,600
like like i'm not trying to like make

603
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,200
you feel guilty or anything like that

604
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,679
i'm trying to say like literally

605
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,120
look at what you are spending time on

606
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,720
right what are you referring to you're

607
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,360
referring to the kardashians what are we

608
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,000
talking about

609
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,679
from twitter to no the kardashians see

610
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
everyone knows that's kind of

611
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,320
fun i'm referring more to like the

612
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,840
economy

613
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,840
you know this idea that

614
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,840
we gotta up our stock price like

615
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,280
or or what is what is the goal function

616
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,440
of humanity

617
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
you don't like the game of capitalism

618
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,559
like you don't like the games we've

619
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
constructed for ourselves as humans

620
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,400
i'm a big fan of of capitalism i don't

621
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,760
think that's really the game we're

622
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
playing right now i think we're playing

623
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,080
a

624
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,159
a different game where the rules are

625
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,320
rigged

626
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,919
look at which games are interesting to

627
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,720
you that we humans have constructed and

628
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,760
which aren't

629
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,159
which are productive and which

630
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,120
are not actually maybe that's the real

631
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,080
point of the

632
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,080
of the talk it's like stop playing these

633
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,720
fake human games there's a real game

634
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,120
here

635
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,120
we can play the real game the real game

636
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,679
is you know nature wrote the rules

637
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,039
this is a real game there still is a

638
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,039
game to play

639
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,000
but if you look at sergeant drop i don't

640
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,240
know if you've seen the instagram

641
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,799
account nature is metal

642
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,600
the game that nature seems to be playing

643
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,640
is a lot

644
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,840
a lot more cruel than we humans want to

645
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,400
put up with or

646
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,880
at least we see it as cool it's like the

647
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,640
bigger

648
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,159
thing eats the smaller thing and uh

649
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,559
does it to impress another big thing

650
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
so it can mate with that thing and

651
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,039
that's it that

652
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,520
seems to be the entirety of it well

653
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,159
there's no art there's no music there's

654
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,360
no

655
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,360
comma ai there's no comma one no comma

656
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,360
two no george

657
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,559
hotz with his brilliant talks at south

658
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,480
by southwest

659
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,640
see i disagree though i disagree that

660
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,320
this is what nature is i think nature

661
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,640
just provided basically a uh

662
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,000
open world and mmorpg and um

663
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
you know here it's open world i mean if

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
that's the game you want to play you can

665
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,919
play that game but

666
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,159
isn't that isn't that beautiful i know

667
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,080
if you play diablo they used to have uh

668
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,600
i think cow level

669
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,360
where it's

670
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,799
so everybody will go just they figured

671
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,880
out this like the best way to gain

672
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,159
like experience points is to just

673
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,200
slaughter cows over and over and over

674
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,960
and uh so they figured out this little

675
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,640
sub game within the bigger game that

676
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,039
this is the most efficient way

677
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,640
to get experience points and everybody

678
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,360
somehow agreed that getting experience

679
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,120
points in

680
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,400
rpg context where you always want to be

681
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,039
getting more stuff

682
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,320
more skills more levels keep advancing

683
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,520
that seems to be good

684
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,080
so might as well spend sacrifice

685
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,520
actual enjoyment of playing a game

686
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,960
exploring a world

687
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,960
and spending like hundreds of hours of

688
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,320
your time in cow level i mean

689
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,080
the number of hours i spent in cow level

690
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,760
i'm not like the most impressive person

691
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,440
because people have probably thousands

692
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,320
of hours there but it's ridiculous

693
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,320
so that's a little absurd game that

694
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,440
brought me joy in some weird dopamine

695
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,919
drug kind of way

696
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,559
yeah so you you don't like those games

697
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,919
you don't

698
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,279
you don't think that's us humans failing

699
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,080
the the yeah nature i think so

700
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,279
and that was the point of the talk yeah

701
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
so how do we hack it then

702
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,240
well i want to live forever and wait

703
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,440
i want to live forever and this is like

704
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,120
the goal well that's a game against

705
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
nature

706
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,360
yeah immortality is the good objective

707
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,559
function to you

708
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,600
i mean start there and then you can do

709
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,279
whatever else you want cause you got a

710
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,200
long time

711
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,559
what if mortality makes the game just

712
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,240
totally not fun

713
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,840
i mean like why do you assume

714
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,880
immortality

715
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,480
is uh somehow uh it's not

716
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,400
a good objective function it's not

717
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,559
immortality that i want a true

718
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,799
immortality where i could not die

719
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,320
i would prefer what we have right now um

720
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,919
but i want to choose my own death of

721
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,760
course

722
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,960
i don't want nature to decide when i die

723
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,840
i'm going to win i'm going to be you

724
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,880
and then at some point if you choose

725
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,520
commit suicide

726
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,919
like how long you think you'd live

727
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
until i get bored see i don't think

728
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,000
people

729
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,799
like in like brilliant people like you

730
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,320
that really

731
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:55,440
ponder living a long time

732
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,880
are really considering how

733
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,000
how meaningless life becomes well i want

734
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
to know everything and then i'm ready

735
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
to die

736
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,480
as long as why do you want isn't it

737
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,080
possible that you want to know

738
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,880
everything because

739
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,720
it's finite like the reason you want to

740
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,279
know quote unquote everything is because

741
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,240
you don't have enough time to know

742
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,799
everything

743
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,000
and once you have unlimited time then

744
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,880
you realize like

745
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,559
why do anything like why learn anything

746
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,080
i want to know everything and i'm ready

747
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,159
to die so you have yeah

748
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,000
well it's not it's not a like it's a

749
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,880
terminal value it's not

750
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,799
it's not in service of anything else i'm

751
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
conscious of the possibility this is not

752
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,960
a certainty

753
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,120
but the possibility is of that engine of

754
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,960
curiosity that you're speaking to

755
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,679
is actually a

756
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,320
a symptom of uh the finiteness of life

757
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,360
like

758
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,600
without that finiteness

759
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,880
your curiosity would vanish like like a

760
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,559
like a morning fog

761
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
all right cool then you talked about

762
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,919
love like that then um

763
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,520
let me solve immortality let me change

764
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,200
the thing in my brain that reminds me of

765
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,720
the fact that i'm immortal tells me that

766
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,960
life is finite maybe i'll have it

767
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,600
tell me that life ends next week

768
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,200
right i'm okay with some self

769
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,320
manipulation like that i'm okay with

770
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,600
with deceiving oh change

771
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,960
oh rico changing the code if that's the

772
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,480
problem right if the problem is that i

773
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,880
will no longer have that

774
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
that curiosity i'd like to have backup

775
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,799
copies of myself

776
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,240
uh which yeah well which i check in with

777
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,919
occasionally to make sure they're okay

778
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,880
with the trajectory and they can kind of

779
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,559
override it

780
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
maybe a nice like i think of like those

781
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,760
wavenets those like logarithmic go back

782
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,279
to the copies yeah but sometimes it's

783
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,600
not reversible like uh

784
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,520
sure i've done this with video games

785
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,480
when once you figure out the cheat code

786
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,480
or like you look up

787
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
how to cheat old school like single

788
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,440
player

789
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,320
it ruins the game for you absolutely i

790
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,840
know that feeling but again

791
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,520
that just means our brain manipulation

792
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,880
technology is not good enough yet remove

793
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,960
that cheat code from your brain

794
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,559
what if we all so it's also possible

795
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,440
that if we figure out immortality

796
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,640
that all of us will kill ourselves

797
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,159
before we advance

798
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,720
far enough to uh to be able to revert to

799
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,919
change

800
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,760
i'm not killing myself till i know

801
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,840
everything so

802
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,840
that's what you say now because your

803
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,520
life is finite

804
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,960
you know i think yes self-modifying

805
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,159
systems gets

806
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
comes up with all these hairy

807
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,000
complexities and can i promise that i'll

808
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,120
do it perfectly no but i think i can put

809
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,840
good safety structures in place

810
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,720
so that talk in your thinking here is

811
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,720
not literally

812
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,080
referring to uh a simulation in that our

813
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,080
our universe is a kind of computer

814
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,760
program running in a computer

815
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,559
that's more of a thought experiment um

816
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,640
do you also think of the potential of

817
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,919
the sort of uh

818
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,320
bostrom elon musk

819
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,679
and others that talk about an actual

820
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,159
program

821
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,240
that simulates our universe oh i don't

822
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,440
doubt that we're in a simulation i just

823
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,520
think that it's not

824
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,960
quite that important i mean i'm

825
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,320
interested only in simulation theory as

826
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,559
far as like it gives me power

827
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,320
over nature uh if it's totally

828
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,840
unfalsifiable then

829
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,760
who cares i mean what do you think that

830
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,240
experiment would look like like somebody

831
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,520
uh

832
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,679
on twitter asked ask george what signs

833
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,799
we would look for to know whether or not

834
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,480
we're in the simulation

835
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,080
which is exactly what you're asking is

836
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,039
like

837
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,720
the step that precedes the step of

838
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,880
knowing how to get more power

839
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,640
from this knowledge is to get an

840
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,919
indication that there is some power to

841
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,720
be gained so

842
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,520
get an indication that there you can

843
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,399
discover

844
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,039
and exploit cracks in the simulation or

845
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,200
it doesn't

846
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,720
you know in the physics of the universe

847
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,919
yeah

848
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,440
show me i mean like a memory leak would

849
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,840
be cool

850
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,279
like some scrying technology you know

851
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,240
what what kind of technology

852
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,360
scrying what's that oh that's a weird uh

853
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,640
this crying is the

854
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,039
is the uh paranormal ability to uh

855
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,520
like like remote viewing like being able

856
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,919
to see somewhere where you're not

857
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,320
um so you know i don't think you can do

858
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,000
it by chanting in a room but um

859
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,480
if we could find as a memory leak

860
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,480
basically

861
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,559
yeah you're able to access parts you're

862
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,080
not supposed to yeah yeah yeah and

863
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,159
thereby discover shortcut

864
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,440
yeah maybe memory leak means the other

865
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,039
thing as well but i mean like yeah like

866
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,799
an ability to read arbitrary memory

867
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,480
yeah right and that one's not that

868
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,360
horrifying right the the right ones

869
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,320
start to be horrifying

870
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,039
read right so the the reading is not the

871
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,360
problem yeah

872
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,559
it's like heartbleed for the universe oh

873
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,520
boy the writing is a big big problem

874
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,279
it's a big problem it's the moment you

875
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,039
can write anything even if it's just

876
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,440
random noise that's terrifying

877
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,640
i mean even without even without that

878
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,559
like even some of the you know the

879
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,559
nanotech stuff that's coming i think is

880
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,399
i don't know if you're paying attention

881
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
but actually eric weinstein came out

882
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,080
with the theory of everything

883
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,840
i mean that came out he's been working

884
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,320
on a theory of everything in the physics

885
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,559
world

886
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,399
called geometric community and then for

887
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,679
me from computer science person

888
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,840
like you stephen wolfram's theory of

889
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,520
everything of like hypographs is super

890
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,440
interesting and beautiful

891
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,960
but not from a physics perspective but

892
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,000
from a computational perspective i don't

893
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,279
know have you paid attention

894
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,120
to any of that so again like what would

895
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,080
make me pay attention and like why like

896
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,200
i hate string theory is okay make a

897
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
testable prediction

898
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,960
right i'm only interested in i'm not

899
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,559
interested in theories for their

900
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,760
intrinsic beauty i'm interested in

901
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,760
theories that give me power over the

902
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,679
universe

903
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,760
so if these theories do i'm very

904
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,799
interested um can i just say how

905
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,279
beautiful that

906
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,840
is because a lot of physicists say i'm

907
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,919
interested in experimental validation

908
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,320
and they skip out the part

909
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,440
where they say to give me more power in

910
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,320
the universe

911
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,600
i just love the um yo i want i want i

912
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,240
want the clarity of that

913
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,000
i want 100 gigahertz processors i want

914
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,799
transistors that are smaller than atoms

915
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
i want like

916
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,200
power

917
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,440
that's uh that's true and that's where

918
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,360
people

919
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,679
from aliens to this kind of technology

920
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,200
where people are worried that

921
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,320
governments like who owns that power

922
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,880
is it george hearts is it thousands of

923
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,760
distributed hackers across the world

924
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,559
is it governments you know is it mark

925
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,399
zuckerberg

926
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,320
there's a lot of people that uh

927
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,159
i don't know if anyone trusts any one

928
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,120
individual with power so they're always

929
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,519
worried

930
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,200
it's the beauty of blockchains that's

931
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,840
the beauty of blockchains

932
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,159
which we'll talk about on twitter

933
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,240
somebody pointed me to a story uh

934
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,200
a bunch of people pointed me to a story

935
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,880
a few months ago

936
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,799
where you went into a restaurant in new

937
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,679
york and you can correct me fame this is

938
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,080
wrong

939
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,039
and ran into a bunch of folks from a

940
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,600
company in a

941
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,760
crypto company who are trying to scale

942
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,200
up ethereum

943
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,279
and they had a technical deadline

944
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,679
related to a solidity to ovm compiler

945
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,720
so these are all ethereum technologies

946
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,640
so

947
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,080
you stepped in they recognized you uh

948
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,840
pulled you aside explained their problem

949
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,039
and you stepped in and helped them solve

950
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,240
the problem

951
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,559
uh thereby creating legend status

952
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,880
story so uh can you uh

953
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,039
tell me the story the little more detail

954
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,799
it seems kind of incredible

955
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,559
this did this happen yeah yeah it's a

956
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,760
true story it's a true story i mean they

957
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,200
wrote a very flattering

958
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,480
account of it um they

959
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,600
so optimism is the spin the company's

960
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,679
called optimism

961
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,679
spin-off of plasma they're trying to

962
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,799
build l2 solutions on ethereum

963
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,600
so right now uh

964
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,559
every ethereum node has to run every

965
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,279
transaction

966
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,799
on the ethereum network um and this kind

967
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,919
of doesn't scale right because if you

968
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,760
have n computers

969
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,039
well you know if that becomes two n

970
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,960
computers you actually still get the

971
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,120
same amount of compute

972
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,320
right this is this is like like o of one

973
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,240
scaling

974
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,440
um because they all have to run it okay

975
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
fine you get more

976
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,200
blockchain security but like the

977
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,360
blockchain's already so secure

978
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,720
can we trade some of that off for speed

979
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,399
uh so that's kind of what these l2

980
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,880
solutions are

981
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,320
they built this thing which kind of um

982
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
kind of sandbox

983
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,799
uh for ethereum contracts so they can

984
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,159
run it in this l2 world and it can't do

985
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,320
certain things in l world

986
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,200
in l1 i can ask you for some definitions

987
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,000
what's l2

988
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,039
oh l2 is layer 2. so l1 is like the base

989
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,760
ethereum chain

990
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,399
and then layer two is like a

991
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,440
computational layer that runs

992
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,600
um elsewhere but still is kind of

993
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,760
secured by layer one

994
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,080
and i'm sure a lot of people know but

995
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,679
ethereum is a cryptocurrency probably

996
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,200
one of the most popular cryptocurrencies

997
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,679
second to bitcoin

998
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,720
and a lot of interesting technological

999
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,840
innovations there

1000
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,919
maybe you can also slip in

1001
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,279
whenever you talk about this any things

1002
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,000
that are exciting to you in the

1003
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,399
ethereum space and why ethereum well i

1004
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
mean

1005
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,200
bitcoin uh is not turn complete

1006
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,639
well ethereum is not technically a

1007
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,839
terrain complete with a gas limit but

1008
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,000
close enough

1009
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,960
well the gas limit what's the gas limit

1010
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,480
resources

1011
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,119
yeah i mean no computers actually turn

1012
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,800
complete right right

1013
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,800
you're fine at ram you know what if i

1014
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,159
can actually solve this gas limit you

1015
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,520
just have so many brilliant

1016
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,960
words i'm not even gonna ask but that's

1017
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,159
what that's no that's not my word that's

1018
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,159
ethereum's word

1019
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,200
gasoline ethereum you have to spend gas

1020
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,639
per instruction

1021
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,480
so like different op codes use different

1022
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,560
amounts of gas and you

1023
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,639
buy gas with ether to prevent people

1024
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,079
from basically ddosing the network

1025
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,000
so uh bitcoin is proof of work and then

1026
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,200
what's ethereum it's also proof of work

1027
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,119
uh they're working on some

1028
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,839
proof-of-stake ethereum 2.0 stuff but

1029
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,200
right now it's

1030
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,119
it's proof of work usually a different

1031
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,280
hash function from bitcoin that's more

1032
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,359
asic resistance because you need ram

1033
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,960
so we're all talking about ethereum 1.0

1034
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,800
yeah so what uh

1035
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,480
what were they trying to do to scale

1036
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
this whole process so they were like

1037
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,839
well

1038
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,520
if we could run contracts elsewhere um

1039
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,359
and then only save the results of that

1040
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,680
computation

1041
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,720
uh you know well we don't actually have

1042
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
to do the computer on the chain we can

1043
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,280
do the compute off chain and just post

1044
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,800
what the results are

1045
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,079
now the problem with that is well

1046
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,040
somebody could lie about what the

1047
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,280
results are

1048
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,960
so you need a resolution mechanism and

1049
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,079
the resolution mechanism can be really

1050
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,400
expensive

1051
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,520
uh because you know you just have to

1052
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,079
make sure that like

1053
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,680
the person who is saying look i swear

1054
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,680
that this is the real computation

1055
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,280
i'm staking ten thousand dollars on that

1056
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,680
fact and

1057
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
if you prove it wrong yeah it might cost

1058
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,640
you three thousand dollars in gas fees

1059
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,839
to prove wrong

1060
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,680
but you'll get the ten thousand dollar

1061
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,800
bounty so you can secure

1062
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,359
using those kind of systems um

1063
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,400
so it's effectively a sandbox which runs

1064
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,040
contracts

1065
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,839
uh and like just like any kind of normal

1066
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,760
sandbox you have to like replace

1067
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,839
syscalls with um you know calls into the

1068
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,359
hypervisor

1069
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,240
uh sandbox this calls hypervisor what do

1070
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,800
these things mean

1071
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,480
uh as long as it's interesting to talk

1072
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
about yeah i mean you can take like the

1073
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,119
chrome

1074
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,560
is maybe the one to think about right so

1075
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,680
the chrome process that's doing a

1076
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,359
rendering

1077
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,720
uh can't for example read a file from

1078
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,480
the file system yeah

1079
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,640
it has if it tries to make an open

1080
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,000
syscall in linux the open system

1081
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,160
you can't make it open says call no no

1082
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,040
no uh you have to request

1083
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,520
from the kind of uh hypervisor process

1084
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,359
or

1085
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,839
like i don't know what's called in

1086
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,839
chrome but um

1087
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,359
the canoe hey could you open this file

1088
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,960
for me and then it does all these checks

1089
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,720
and then it passes the file handle back

1090
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,200
in if it's approved

1091
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,280
um so that's yeah uh so what's the in

1092
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,119
the context of ethereum

1093
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,800
what are the boundaries of the sandbox

1094
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,720
that we're talking about um well like

1095
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,200
one of the calls that you

1096
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,680
actually reading and uh writing any

1097
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,800
state to the ethereum contract

1098
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,040
to the ethereum blockchain um

1099
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,119
writing state is one of those calls that

1100
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,240
you're going to have to sandbox

1101
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,880
in layer two because if you let layer

1102
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,640
two just

1103
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,320
arbitrarily right to the ethereum

1104
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,800
blockchain um

1105
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,000
so layer two is except is really sitting

1106
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
on top of

1107
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,440
layer one so you're gonna have a lot of

1108
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,160
different kinds of ideas that you can

1109
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,680
play with

1110
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,359
yeah and they're all they're not

1111
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,119
fundamentally changing

1112
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,079
the source code level of ethereum

1113
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,800
well you have to replace a bunch of

1114
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,200
calls

1115
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,839
with calls into the hypervisor so

1116
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,760
instead of doing the syscall directly

1117
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,200
you you replace it with a call to the

1118
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,400
hypervisor

1119
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,640
so originally they were doing this by

1120
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,480
first running the so solidity is the

1121
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,280
language that most ethereum contracts

1122
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,920
are written in

1123
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,960
it compiles to a byte code and then they

1124
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,280
wrote this thing they called the

1125
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
transpiler and the transpiler took the

1126
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
byte code

1127
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,920
and it transpiled it into ovm safe

1128
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,440
bytecode

1129
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,119
basically bytecode that didn't make any

1130
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,680
of those restricted syscalls and added

1131
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,520
the calls to the hypervisor

1132
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,920
this transpiler was a 3000 line mess

1133
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,119
and it's hard to do it's hard to do if

1134
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,640
you're trying to do it like that because

1135
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,160
you have to kind of like deconstruct the

1136
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,440
byte code

1137
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,280
change things about it and then

1138
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,880
reconstruct it

1139
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,480
and i mean as soon as i hear this i'm

1140
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,839
like why don't you just change the

1141
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,760
compiler

1142
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,320
right why not the first place you build

1143
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,040
the bytecode just do it in the compiler

1144
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,240
uh so yeah you know i asked them how

1145
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,200
much they wanted it

1146
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,320
uh of course measured in dollars and i'm

1147
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,760
like well okay

1148
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,000
um and yeah and you wrote the compiler

1149
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,880
yeah i modified i wrote a 300 line diff

1150
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
to the compiler

1151
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,400
uh it's open source you can look at it

1152
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,150
yeah it's yeah i looked at the code last

1153
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,359
night

1154
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:48,079
[Laughter]

1155
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,560
yeah exactly cute good is a good word

1156
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,920
for it

1157
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,040
uh and it's um c plus plus

1158
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,200
see if it's lost yeah so when

1159
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,720
asked how you were able to do it you

1160
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,280
said

1161
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,960
you just gotta think and then do it

1162
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,640
right

1163
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,640
so can you break that apart a little bit

1164
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,760
what's what's your process of uh

1165
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,839
one thinking and two doing it right

1166
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,359
you know they they the people i was

1167
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,720
working for are amused that i said that

1168
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,920
it doesn't really mean anything

1169
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,040
okay i mean is there some

1170
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,599
deep profound insights to draw from like

1171
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,880
how you problem solve from that because

1172
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,240
this is always what i say i'm like do

1173
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,680
you want to be a good programmer do it

1174
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,440
for 20 years

1175
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,880
yeah there's no shortcuts yeah

1176
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,800
what are your thoughts on crypto in

1177
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,359
general so would

1178
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,800
what what parts technically or

1179
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,920
philosophically do you find especially

1180
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,160
beautiful maybe

1181
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,960
oh i'm extremely bullish on crypto long

1182
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,480
term not any specific crypto project

1183
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,839
but this idea of

1184
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,960
well two ideas one um

1185
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,200
the nakamoto consensus algorithm is

1186
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,480
i think one of the greatest innovations

1187
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,560
of the 21st century

1188
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,240
this idea that people can reach

1189
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,359
consensus you can reach a group

1190
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,119
consensus

1191
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,480
using a relatively straightforward

1192
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,079
algorithm

1193
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,240
um is wild and

1194
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,240
like you know satoshi nakamoto people

1195
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,119
always ask me who i look up to it's like

1196
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,440
whoever that is who do you think it is i

1197
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,200
mean

1198
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,079
elon musk is it you it is definitely not

1199
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,599
me and i do not think it's elon musk

1200
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:32,079
but yeah this idea of uh

1201
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,880
groups reaching consensus in a

1202
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,960
decentralized yet formulaic way

1203
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,839
is one extremely powerful idea from

1204
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,839
crypto

1205
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,680
maybe the second idea is this idea of

1206
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,560
smart contracts

1207
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,040
when you write a contract between two

1208
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,160
parties

1209
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,400
any contract um this contract

1210
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,079
if there are disputes it's interpreted

1211
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,880
by lawyers

1212
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,920
lawyers are just really shitty overpaid

1213
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
interpreters

1214
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,720
imagine you had let's talk about them in

1215
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,160
terms of a in terms of like let's

1216
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,000
compare a lawyer to python

1217
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,160
right so lawyer well okay that's really

1218
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,200
oh i never thought of it that way it's

1219
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,319
hilarious

1220
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,079
so python i'm paying i'm paying um

1221
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,760
you know even 10 cents an hour i'll use

1222
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,599
the nice azure machine i can run python

1223
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,359
for 10 cents an hour

1224
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,200
lawyers cost a thousand dollars an hour

1225
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,800
so python is is is

1226
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,960
10 000 x uh better on that axis um

1227
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,319
lawyers don't always return the same

1228
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,319
answer

1229
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,760
um python almost always does

1230
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:40,880
uh cost

1231
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,319
yeah i mean just just cost reliability

1232
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,240
everything about python is so much

1233
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,920
better than lawyers um so if you can

1234
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,319
make smart contracts

1235
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,720
this whole concept of code is law

1236
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,520
i i love and i would love to live in a

1237
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,040
world where everybody accepted that fact

1238
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,000
so so maybe uh you can talk about what

1239
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,760
smart contracts

1240
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,520
are so let's say um

1241
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,240
let's say you know we have a uh

1242
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,359
even something as simple as a safety

1243
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,599
deposit box

1244
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,640
right safety deposit box that holds a

1245
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,319
million dollars

1246
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,200
i have a contract with the bank that

1247
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:23,200
says two out of these three parties

1248
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,119
uh must uh be present to open the safety

1249
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,319
deposit box and get the money out

1250
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,760
so that's a contract for the bank and

1251
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,960
it's only as good as the bank and the

1252
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,720
lawyers right

1253
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,079
let's say you know somebody dies and now

1254
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,680
oh we're going to go through a big legal

1255
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,520
dispute about whether oh well was it in

1256
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,079
the will was it not in the well

1257
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,640
what like it's just so messy and the

1258
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,480
cost

1259
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,480
to determine truth is so expensive

1260
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,000
versus a smart contract which just uses

1261
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,000
cryptography to check if two out of

1262
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,880
three keys are present

1263
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,760
well i can look at that and i can have

1264
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,920
certainty

1265
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,200
in the answer that it's going to return

1266
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,960
that's what all businesses want

1267
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,720
certainty you know they say businesses

1268
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,800
don't care viacom youtube

1269
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,000
youtube's like look we don't care which

1270
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
way this lawsuit goes

1271
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,160
just please tell us so we can have

1272
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,599
certainty yeah i wonder how many

1273
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,760
agreements in this world because we're

1274
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,640
talking about financial transactions

1275
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,319
only in this case correct the smart the

1276
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,200
smart contracts oh you can go to you can

1277
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,640
go to anything

1278
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,359
you can go you could put a prenup in the

1279
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,359
theorem blockchain

1280
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,200
a married smart contract sorry divorce

1281
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,000
lawyers sorry you're going gonna be

1282
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,520
replaced by

1283
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,800
python uh

1284
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,880
okay so that's uh

1285
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,240
so that's that's another beautiful idea

1286
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,520
do you think

1287
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,960
there's something that's appealing to

1288
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,160
you about any one specific

1289
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,079
implementation

1290
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,960
so if you look 10 20 50 years down the

1291
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,000
line

1292
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,359
do you see any like bitcoin ethereum

1293
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,440
any of the other hundreds of

1294
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,880
cryptocurrencies winning out is there

1295
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,319
like what's your intuition about the

1296
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,079
space are you just sitting back and

1297
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,200
watching the chaos and look who cares

1298
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,040
what emerges

1299
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,800
oh i don't i don't speculate i don't

1300
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,640
really care i don't really care which

1301
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,160
one of these projects wins

1302
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,480
i'm kind of in the bitcoin as a meme

1303
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,960
coin camp i mean why does bitcoin have

1304
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,880
value

1305
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,520
it's technically kind of you know

1306
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,240
what yeah not great like the block size

1307
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,599
debate or

1308
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,359
when i found out what the block size

1309
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,040
debate was i'm like are you guys

1310
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,040
kidding what's the block size debate

1311
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,480
you know what it's really it's too

1312
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,000
stupid to even talk about people

1313
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,480
people people can look it up but i'm

1314
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,800
like wow you know ethereum seems the

1315
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,720
governance of ethereum seems much better

1316
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,720
um i've come around i've been on proof

1317
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,560
of stake ideas

1318
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,560
uh you know very smart people thinking

1319
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,640
about some things yeah

1320
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,000
you know governance is interesting it

1321
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,200
does feel like uh

1322
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,359
vitalik it could just feel like an

1323
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,119
open in even in these distributed

1324
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,640
systems leaders and

1325
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,800
are helpful because they kind of

1326
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,760
help you drive the mission and the

1327
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,560
vision

1328
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,000
and they put a face to a project it's a

1329
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,720
weird thing about us humans

1330
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,280
geniuses are helpful like mattel right

1331
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,839
yeah

1332
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,839
brilliant

1333
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,119
leaders are not necessarily yeah

1334
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,640
so you think the reason he's uh he's the

1335
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,960
face

1336
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,000
of a theorem is because he's a genius

1337
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,359
that's interesting

1338
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,040
i mean that was um

1339
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,839
it's interesting to think about that we

1340
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:29,440
need to create systems

1341
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,240
in which uh the quote unquote leaders

1342
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,359
that emerge

1343
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,920
are the geniuses in the system i mean

1344
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,760
that's

1345
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,680
arguably why the current state of

1346
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,160
democracy is broken is the people who

1347
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,000
are

1348
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,480
emerging as the leaders are not the most

1349
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,280
competent are not the superstars of the

1350
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,040
system

1351
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,119
and it seems like at least for now in

1352
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,760
the crypto world oftentimes

1353
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,599
the leaders are the superstars imagine

1354
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,839
at the debate they asked

1355
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,680
what's the sixth amendment what are the

1356
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,440
four fundamental forces in the universe

1357
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,720
right what's the integral of two to the

1358
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,040
x

1359
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,480
yeah i i'd love to see those questions

1360
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,200
asked and that's what i want as our

1361
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,800
leader

1362
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,800
it's it's a little bit of a bayes rule

1363
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,280
yeah i mean even oh wow you're hurting

1364
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,280
my brain

1365
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:18,240
it's that my standard was even lower but

1366
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,680
i would have loved to see just this

1367
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,280
basic

1368
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,040
brilliance like i've talked to

1369
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,400
historians there's just these

1370
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,760
they're not even like they don't have a

1371
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,240
phd or even education history they just

1372
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,839
like a dan carlin type character who

1373
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,160
just like

1374
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,280
holy how did all this information

1375
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,000
get into your head

1376
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,040
they're able to just connect uh genghis

1377
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,720
khan to

1378
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,160
the entirety of the history of the 20th

1379
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,640
century they

1380
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,079
they know everything about every single

1381
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,200
battle that happened

1382
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,400
and they know the the the like

1383
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,240
the game of thrones of the of the

1384
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,040
different power plays and all that

1385
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
happened there

1386
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,400
and they know like the individuals they

1387
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,720
know all the documents involved

1388
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,400
and it's and that they integrate that

1389
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,720
into their regular life it's not like

1390
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,720
they're ultra history nerds they're just

1391
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,960
they know this information that's what

1392
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,160
competence looks like yeah

1393
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,839
because i've seen that with programmers

1394
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,480
too right that's what great programmers

1395
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,200
do

1396
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,640
but yeah it would be uh it's really

1397
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,599
unfortunate that those kinds of people

1398
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,920
aren't emerging as as our leaders but

1399
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,839
for

1400
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,200
now at least in the crypto world that

1401
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,160
seems to be the case

1402
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,680
i don't know if that always uh you could

1403
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,839
imagine that in a hundred years that's

1404
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,920
not the case right the crypto world has

1405
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,920
one very powerful idea going for it and

1406
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,040
that's the idea of forks

1407
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,319
right i mean

1408
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,559
you know imagine uh

1409
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,800
we'll use a less controversial example

1410
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,800
um this was actually in my joke

1411
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,240
uh app in 2012 i was like barack obama

1412
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,520
mitt romney let's let him both be

1413
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,800
president right like imagine we could

1414
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,480
fork america

1415
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,000
and just let them both be president and

1416
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,079
then the americas could compete

1417
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,599
and you know people could invest in one

1418
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,400
pull their liquidity out of one put it

1419
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,319
in the other

1420
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,839
you have this in the crypto world

1421
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,440
ethereum forks into ethereum and

1422
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,960
ethereum classic

1423
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,880
and you can pull your liquidity out of

1424
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,920
one and put it in another

1425
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,920
and people vote with their dollars um

1426
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,319
which forks companies should be able to

1427
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,319
fork

1428
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:22,640
i'd love to fork nvidia you know

1429
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,800
yeah like different business strategies

1430
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,440
and yeah and then try them out and see

1431
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,440
see what works like even take uh

1432
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,640
uh yeah take comedy i that closes its

1433
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,640
source

1434
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,240
and then take one that's open source and

1435
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,280
see what works

1436
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,400
take one that's purchased by gm and one

1437
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,240
that remains

1438
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,319
android renegade and all these different

1439
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,599
versions and see the beauty of comma ai

1440
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,480
is someone could actually do that

1441
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,040
yeah please take come ai and fork it

1442
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,440
that's right

1443
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,640
that's the beauty of open source so

1444
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,000
you're i mean

1445
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,200
we'll talk about autonomous vehicle

1446
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,480
space but it does seem that

1447
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,559
you're really knowledgeable about

1448
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,000
a lot of different topics so the natural

1449
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,280
question a bunch of people ask this

1450
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,839
which is

1451
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,319
uh how do you keep learning new things

1452
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,960
do you have

1453
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,319
like practical advice if you were to

1454
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,599
introspect

1455
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:19,760
like taking notes allocate time

1456
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,680
or do you just mess around and just

1457
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,119
allow your curiosity to drive i'll write

1458
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,400
these people a self-help book and i'll

1459
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,680
charge 67

1460
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,040
for it and i will i will write i will

1461
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,000
write chapter one i will write on the

1462
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,680
cover of the self-help

1463
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,440
book all of this advice is completely

1464
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,480
meaningless you're gonna be a sucker and

1465
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,960
buy this book anyway

1466
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,720
yeah and the one lesson that i hope they

1467
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,960
take away from the book

1468
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,400
is that i can't give you a meaningful

1469
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,640
answer to that

1470
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,440
that's interesting let me translate that

1471
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,520
is you haven't really thought about what

1472
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,599
it is you do

1473
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,960
systematically because you could reduce

1474
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,359
it and there's some people i mean i've

1475
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,480
met

1476
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:00,160
brilliant people that this is really

1477
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,119
clear with athletes

1478
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,040
some are just you know the best in the

1479
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,800
world that's something

1480
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,880
and they they have zero interest in

1481
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,680
writing like a self-help book

1482
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,000
but or how to master this game and then

1483
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,520
there's

1484
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,200
some athletes who become great coaches

1485
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,280
and they love the analysis

1486
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,559
perhaps the over analysis and you right

1487
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,079
now at least at your age

1488
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,680
which isn't interesting you're in the

1489
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,599
middle of the battle you're like the

1490
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,960
warriors that have zero interest in

1491
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,960
writing books

1492
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,400
uh so you're in the middle of the battle

1493
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,079
so you have yeah

1494
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,920
this is this is a fair point i do think

1495
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,440
i have a certain aversion

1496
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,559
to um this kind of deliberate

1497
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,280
intentional way of living life

1498
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,920
here eventually the hilarity of this

1499
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,040
especially

1500
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,040
since this is recorded

1501
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,119
it will reveal beautifully the absurdity

1502
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,079
when you finally do publish this book

1503
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,440
and i guarantee you you will the story

1504
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,520
of comma ai

1505
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,720
would be maybe it'll be a biography

1506
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,400
written about you

1507
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,920
they'll be they'll be better i guess and

1508
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,440
you might be able to learn some cute

1509
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,280
lessons if you're starting a company

1510
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,280
like comma ai from that book

1511
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,000
but if you're asking generic questions

1512
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,720
like how do i be good at things

1513
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
dude i don't know well learn i mean the

1514
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,079
interesting do them a lot

1515
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,200
i do them a lot but the interesting

1516
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,400
thing here is

1517
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,240
learning things outside

1518
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,440
of your current trajectory which is what

1519
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,000
it feels like from an outsider's

1520
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,559
perspective i mean that

1521
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,640
uh you know that i don't know if there's

1522
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,280
an advice on that

1523
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,640
but it is an interesting curiosity when

1524
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,839
you become really busy

1525
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:41,440
you're running a company

1526
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:43,760
part time yeah

1527
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,040
but like there's a natural inclination

1528
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,839
and

1529
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,319
trend like just the the the momentum of

1530
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,920
life

1531
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:52,160
carries you into a particular direction

1532
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,200
of wanting to focus and this kind of

1533
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:58,240
dispersion that curiosity can lead to

1534
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,559
gets harder and harder with time because

1535
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,800
you're

1536
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,160
you get really good at certain things

1537
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,680
and it sucks

1538
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,280
trying things that you're not good at

1539
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,280
like trying to figure them out

1540
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,319
you do this with your live streams

1541
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,559
you're on the

1542
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,359
fly figuring stuff out you don't mind

1543
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,359
looking dumb

1544
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,520
you just figured out figure it out

1545
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,040
pretty quickly sometimes i try things

1546
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,200
and i don't figure them out

1547
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,160
my chest rating is like a 1400 despite

1548
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,160
putting like

1549
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,319
a couple hundred hours in it's pathetic

1550
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,760
i mean to be fair i know that i could do

1551
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,280
it better if i did it better like don't

1552
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,680
play you know don't play five-minute

1553
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,079
games play 15-minute games at least like

1554
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,839
i know these things but it just doesn't

1555
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,119
it doesn't stick nicely in my knowledge

1556
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,280
tree

1557
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,000
all right let's talk about comma ai

1558
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,640
what's the mission of the company

1559
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,800
let's like look at the biggest picture

1560
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,359
oh i have an exact statement

1561
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,440
solve self-driving cars while delivering

1562
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,559
shippable intermediaries

1563
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,640
so long-term vision is have

1564
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,800
fully autonomous vehicles and make sure

1565
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,079
you're making money along the way

1566
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,599
i think it doesn't really speak to money

1567
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,119
but i can talk i can talk about what

1568
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,280
solve self-driving cars means

1569
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,640
solve self-driving cars of course means

1570
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,079
um

1571
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,079
you're not building a new car you're

1572
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,760
building a person replacement

1573
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,760
uh that person can sit in the driver's

1574
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,480
seat and drive you anywhere a person can

1575
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,920
drive

1576
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,119
with a human or better level of safety

1577
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,119
speed quality comfort

1578
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,359
and what's the second part of that

1579
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,040
delivering shippable intermediaries

1580
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,640
um is well it's a way to fund the

1581
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,800
company that's true but it's also a way

1582
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,160
to keep us honest

1583
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,800
uh if you don't have that it is very

1584
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,079
easy

1585
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,000
with this technology to think you're

1586
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,599
making progress when you're not

1587
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,359
i've heard it best described on hacker

1588
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,559
news as

1589
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:48,559
you can set any arbitrary milestone

1590
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,760
meet that milestone and still be

1591
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,599
infinitely far away from solving

1592
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,680
self-driving cars

1593
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,119
so it's hard to have like real deadlines

1594
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,240
when you're like

1595
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:02,000
cruz or waymo

1596
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:05,760
when uh you don't have uh revenue

1597
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,839
is that i mean is revenue essentially

1598
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,800
the thing we're talking about here

1599
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,359
revenue is

1600
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,960
is capitalism is based around consent

1601
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,520
capitalism the way that you get revenue

1602
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,520
is kind of

1603
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,640
real capitalism commas in the real

1604
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,680
capital is in camp there's definitely

1605
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,359
scams out there but

1606
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,800
real capitalism is based around consent

1607
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,760
it's based around this idea that like if

1608
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,119
we're getting revenue

1609
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,800
it's because we're providing at least

1610
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,400
that much value another person when

1611
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,280
someone buys a thousand dollar comment

1612
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
two from us

1613
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,520
we're providing them at least a thousand

1614
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,960
dollars of value where they wouldn't buy

1615
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,960
it brilliant

1616
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,160
so can you give a whirlwind overview of

1617
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,280
the products that come i

1618
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,079
provides like uh throughout its history

1619
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,000
and today

1620
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,760
i mean yeah the past ones aren't really

1621
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,119
that interesting it's kind of just been

1622
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,040
refinement of the same idea uh

1623
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,799
the real only product we sell today is

1624
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,440
the comma two which is a piece of

1625
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,680
hardware

1626
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,799
with cameras um so the comet to

1627
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,200
i mean you can think about it kind of

1628
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:58,559
like a person uh you know when future

1629
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,839
hardware will probably be even more and

1630
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,119
more person-like

1631
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:06,720
um so it has uh you know eyes

1632
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,359
ears a mouth a brain

1633
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,799
uh and a way to interface with the car

1634
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,640
does it have consciousness

1635
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,240
just kidding that was a trick question

1636
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,040
because i don't have consciousness

1637
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,319
either

1638
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,599
me and the common two are the same

1639
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,480
they're the same i have a little more

1640
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,160
compute than it

1641
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,680
it only has like the same computer

1642
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,640
interesting b

1643
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,280
uh you know you're more efficient energy

1644
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,720
wise

1645
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,319
for the compute you're doing far more

1646
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,799
efficient energy-wise

1647
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,079
huh 20 paid flaps 20 watts crazy you

1648
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,559
lack consciousness

1649
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,839
sure do you fear death you do you want

1650
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,359
immortality

1651
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:41,280
does comey i fear death i don't think so

1652
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,799
of course it does it very much fears

1653
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,160
while it fears negative loss

1654
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:48,640
oh yeah okay

1655
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,400
so come a comma two when did that come

1656
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,520
out that that was a year ago

1657
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,880
no two uh early this year

1658
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:00,160
wow time it feels like yeah

1659
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,760
2020 feels like uh it's taken 10 years

1660
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,960
to get to the end it's a long year

1661
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:07,520
it's a long year so um

1662
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,079
what uh what's the sexiest thing about

1663
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,359
comma

1664
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,480
too feature-wise so i mean maybe you can

1665
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:15,599
also link on like

1666
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,880
what is it like what's its purpose

1667
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,480
because there's a hardware there's a

1668
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,880
software component

1669
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,160
you've mentioned the sensors but also

1670
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,960
like what is of its features and

1671
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,280
capabilities

1672
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,720
i think our slogan summarizes it well uh

1673
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:32,480
comma slogan is make driving chill

1674
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,240
i love it okay yeah i mean it is

1675
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,079
you know if you like cruise control

1676
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,839
imagine cruise control but much much

1677
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,559
more

1678
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,319
so it can uh do adaptive cruise control

1679
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,079
things which is like slow down for cars

1680
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,480
in front of it maintain a certain speed

1681
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,839
and you can also do lane keeping so

1682
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,960
staying in the lane

1683
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,720
and doing it better and better and

1684
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,040
better over time that's very much

1685
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,200
machine learning based

1686
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,079
so this camera is there's a driver

1687
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,359
facing camera

1688
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:02,640
too that's

1689
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:04,960
um what else is there what am i thinking

1690
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,760
so the hardware versus software so

1691
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,880
open pilot versus the actual hardware of

1692
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,400
the device

1693
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,760
what's can you draw that distinction

1694
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,040
what's one what's the other i mean the

1695
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,960
hardware is pretty much

1696
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,880
a cell phone with a few additions a cell

1697
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,000
phone with a cooling system

1698
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,880
and with a car interface connecting to

1699
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,119
it

1700
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,200
and as by cell phone you mean uh like

1701
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,400
qualcomm snapdragon

1702
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,400
uh yeah the current hardware is a

1703
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,720
snapdragon 821

1704
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,400
uh it has wi-fi radio it has an lte

1705
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,920
radio it has a screen

1706
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,520
uh we use every part of the cell phone

1707
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,960
and then the interface of the car is

1708
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,040
specific to the car so you keep

1709
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,559
supporting more and more cars

1710
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,480
um yeah so the interface to the car i

1711
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,200
mean the device itself just has four can

1712
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,880
buses

1713
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,079
has four cam interfaces on it that are

1714
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,359
connected through the usb port to the

1715
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,880
phone

1716
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:54,720
um and then yeah on those four can buses

1717
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,319
uh you connect it to the car and there's

1718
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,319
a little harness to do this

1719
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,400
cars are actually surprisingly similar

1720
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,440
so can is the the protocol by which cars

1721
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,440
communicate

1722
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,280
and then you're able to read stuff and

1723
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,599
write stuff to be able to control the

1724
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,520
car

1725
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,839
depending on the car so what's the

1726
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,079
software side what's open pilot

1727
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,680
um so i mean open pilot is the hardware

1728
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,599
is pretty simple compared to open pilot

1729
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,040
open pilot is

1730
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:20,960
uh well

1731
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,960
so you have a machine learning model

1732
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,119
which it's an open pilot it's a

1733
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,640
you know it's a blob it's just a blob of

1734
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,319
weights it's not like people are like oh

1735
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,839
it's closed source i'm like it's a blob

1736
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,559
of weights what do you expect

1737
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,599
um you know primarily neural network

1738
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,079
based

1739
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,680
ul open pilot is all the software kind

1740
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,960
of around that neural network that if

1741
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,640
you have a neural network that says

1742
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,040
here's where you want to send the car

1743
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,720
openpilot actually goes and executes all

1744
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,319
of that

1745
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,000
it cleans up the input to the neural

1746
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,079
network it cleans up the output and

1747
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,440
executes on it so it connects

1748
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,440
it's the glue that connects everything

1749
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,520
together runs the sensors does a bunch

1750
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,920
of calibration for the neural network

1751
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,760
does you know deals with like you know

1752
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,599
if the car is on a banked road

1753
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,799
uh you have to counter steer against

1754
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,240
that and the neural network can't

1755
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,240
necessarily know that by looking at the

1756
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,000
picture

1757
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,680
so you do that with with other sensors

1758
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,720
infusion and localizer

1759
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,880
openpilot also is responsible for

1760
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,640
sending the data up to our servers so we

1761
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,240
can learn from it

1762
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,359
logging it recording it running the

1763
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,040
cameras thermally managing the device

1764
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,640
managing the disk space on the device

1765
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,880
managing all the resources of the device

1766
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,559
so what um since we last spoke i don't

1767
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,079
remember when maybe a year ago maybe a

1768
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,280
little bit longer

1769
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,720
how uh has open pilot improved we did

1770
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,160
exactly what i promised you

1771
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,920
i promised you that by the end of the

1772
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:43,119
year you'd be able to remove the lanes

1773
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,079
um the lateral policy is now

1774
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:48,400
uh almost completely end to end you can

1775
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,920
turn the lanes off and it will drive

1776
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,760
drive slightly worse on the highway if

1777
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,200
you turn the lanes off but you can turn

1778
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,079
the lanes off and it will drive

1779
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,040
well trained completely end to end on

1780
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,559
user data

1781
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,240
um and this year we hope to do the same

1782
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,200
for the longitudinal policy so that's

1783
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,240
the interesting thing

1784
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,839
is you're not doing you don't appear to

1785
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,920
be you can correct me you don't appear

1786
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:10,799
to be doing lean

1787
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,119
detection or lane marking detection or

1788
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:15,359
kind of the segmentation task or

1789
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,240
any kind of object detection task you're

1790
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,680
doing what's

1791
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,359
traditionally more called like

1792
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,040
end-to-end learning

1793
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:24,000
so and trained on actual behavior of

1794
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,599
drivers

1795
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,240
when they're driving the car manually

1796
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,079
and this is hard to do you know it's not

1797
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,839
supervised learning

1798
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,000
yeah but uh so the nice thing is there's

1799
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:38,799
a lot of data so it's hard and easy

1800
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,920
right it's uh we have a lot of high

1801
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,599
quality data yeah

1802
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,599
like more than you need in the senate

1803
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,799
well we way more than we do we have way

1804
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,640
more data than we need

1805
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,000
i mean it's it's an interesting question

1806
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,599
actually because

1807
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,440
in terms of amount you have more than

1808
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,359
you need

1809
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,040
but the you know driving is full of edge

1810
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:58,160
cases so how do you

1811
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,000
select the data you train on

1812
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,599
i i think this is an interesting open

1813
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,079
question like what's

1814
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,680
what's the cleverest way to select data

1815
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,280
that's the question tesla is probably

1816
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,359
working on

1817
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,480
uh that's i mean the entirety of machine

1818
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,839
learning can be they don't seem to

1819
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,680
really care they just kind of select

1820
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:15,119
data but i feel like that

1821
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,400
if you want to solve if you want to

1822
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,319
create intelligent systems you have to

1823
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,040
pick data well

1824
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:22,799
right and so would you have any hints

1825
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:26,000
ideas of how to do it well

1826
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,599
so in some ways that is the definition i

1827
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,200
like of reinforcement learning versus

1828
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,119
supervised learning

1829
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,559
in supervised learning the weights

1830
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,839
depend on the data

1831
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,559
right um and this is obviously true but

1832
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,640
the

1833
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,400
uh in reinforcement learning the data

1834
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,799
depends on the weights

1835
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,920
yeah right and actually both ways that's

1836
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,520
that's poetry

1837
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,359
so it's brilliant how does it know what

1838
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,559
data to turn on well let it pick

1839
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,559
we're not there yet but that's the

1840
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,160
eventual so you're thinking this

1841
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,079
almost like a reinforcement learning

1842
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,359
framework we're going to do rl on the

1843
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,440
world

1844
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,400
every time a car makes a mistake user

1845
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,680
disengages we

1846
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,200
train on that and do our all in the

1847
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,200
world ship out a new model that's an

1848
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,400
epoch right

1849
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,720
and uh for now you're not

1850
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,160
doing the elon style promising that it's

1851
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,400
going to be fully autonomous you really

1852
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,880
are sticking to level two

1853
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,400
and like it's supposed to be supervised

1854
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,599
oh it is definitely supposed to be

1855
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,559
supervising reinforced the fact that

1856
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,160
it's supervised

1857
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:24,559
um we look at our rate of improvement

1858
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,240
in disengagements um open pilot now has

1859
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,280
an unplanned engagement about every 100

1860
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,480
miles

1861
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:35,359
this is up from 10 miles like

1862
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,200
maybe maybe uh

1863
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,039
maybe a year ago yeah so maybe we've

1864
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,760
seen 10x improvement in a year but

1865
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,960
a hundred miles is still a far cry from

1866
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,760
the hundred thousand you're going to

1867
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,680
need

1868
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,880
so you're going to somehow need to get

1869
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,400
um

1870
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,480
three more 10xs in there and your

1871
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,920
what's your intuition uh you're

1872
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,520
basically hoping that there's

1873
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,880
exponential improvement built into the

1874
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,319
baked into the cake somewhere well

1875
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,000
that's even like i mean 10x improvement

1876
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,760
that's already assuming exponential

1877
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,680
right there's definitely exponential

1878
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,720
improvement and i think when elon talks

1879
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,319
about exponential like

1880
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,760
these things these systems are going to

1881
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,839
exponentially improve

1882
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,520
just exponential doesn't mean you're

1883
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,480
getting 100 gigahertz processors

1884
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,559
tomorrow

1885
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,079
right like it's going to still take a

1886
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,720
while because the gap

1887
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,079
between even our best system and humans

1888
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,839
is still large

1889
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,839
so that's an interesting distinction to

1890
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:26,000
draw so if you look at the way tesla's

1891
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,119
approaching the problem

1892
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,680
and the way you're approaching the

1893
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,640
problem which is very different than the

1894
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,280
rest of the

1895
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,760
self-driving car world so let's put them

1896
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,000
aside

1897
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,440
is you're treating most the driving task

1898
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,200
is a machine learning problem

1899
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,880
and the way tesla is approaching it is

1900
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,599
with the multi-task learning

1901
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,280
where you break the task of driving into

1902
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,359
hundreds of different desks

1903
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,760
and you have this multi-headed neural

1904
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:52,319
network that's very good at

1905
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,640
performing each task and there there's

1906
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,000
presumably something on top that's

1907
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:00,079
stitching stuff together in order to uh

1908
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,079
make controlled decisions policy

1909
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,440
decisions about how you move the car

1910
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,359
but what that allows you there's a

1911
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,680
brilliance to this because it allows you

1912
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,799
to

1913
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:13,359
um master each task like

1914
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:16,319
lane detection uh stop sign detection

1915
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:18,799
traffic light detection uh drivable area

1916
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,720
segmentation

1917
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:22,319
uh you know vehicle bicycle pedestrian

1918
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,480
detection

1919
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,440
uh there's some localization tasks in

1920
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:29,359
there

1921
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:32,480
also predicting of

1922
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,920
like yeah predicting how the the

1923
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,680
entities in the scene are going to move

1924
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,720
like everything is basically a machine

1925
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,920
learning task well there's a

1926
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,680
classification

1927
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,200
segmentation prediction and

1928
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,760
it's nice because you can have this

1929
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,000
entire engine data engine that's mining

1930
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,760
for edge cases

1931
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,680
for each one of these tasks and you can

1932
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,599
have people like engineers that are

1933
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,039
basically masters of that task

1934
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,520
like becoming the best person in the

1935
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,920
world that uh as you talk about the cone

1936
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,480
guy

1937
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,039
for uh for for waymo the good old phone

1938
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,640
guy

1939
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,039
the the becoming the best person in the

1940
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,920
world at uh at uh

1941
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,680
at cone detection i i so that's a

1942
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,160
compelling notion from a supervised

1943
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,720
learning perspective

1944
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,880
automating much of the process of

1945
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,559
educates discovery and retraining neural

1946
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,119
network for each of the individual

1947
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,000
perception tasks and then you're looking

1948
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,680
at the machine learning

1949
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,880
in a more holistic way basically doing

1950
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:30,160
end-to-end learning

1951
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,799
on the driving task supervised trained

1952
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:36,240
on the data of the actual

1953
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:37,920
driving of people that use comma ai

1954
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,319
like actual human drivers do manual

1955
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,599
control plus the

1956
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:46,000
moments of disengagement that uh

1957
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,520
maybe with some labeling could indicate

1958
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,720
the failure of the system so you have

1959
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,799
the

1960
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,760
you have a huge amount of data for

1961
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,599
positive

1962
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,599
control of the vehicle like successful

1963
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,799
control of the vehicle

1964
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,920
both maintaining the lane as as i think

1965
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:02,000
you're also working on

1966
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,400
longitudinal control of the vehicle and

1967
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,039
then failure cases where the vehicle

1968
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,319
does something

1969
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,880
wrong that needs disengagement

1970
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:13,039
so like what why do you think you're

1971
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,920
right and tesla is wrong

1972
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,599
on this and do you think do you think

1973
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,039
you'll come around the tesla way do you

1974
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:22,559
think tesla will come around

1975
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,760
to your way if you were to start a chess

1976
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,200
engine company

1977
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:30,799
would you hire a bishop guy see we have

1978
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:33,610
uh this is monday morning quarterbacking

1979
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,839
as uh yes probably

1980
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:38,079
[Laughter]

1981
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:39,520
so oh oh our rook guy oh we stole the

1982
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,240
rook guy from that company oh we're

1983
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,839
gonna have real good

1984
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:47,119
rooks well there's not many pieces right

1985
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:49,680
you can uh yeah there's not many

1986
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,520
guys and gals to hire you just have a

1987
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,559
few that work on the bishop a few that

1988
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,720
work in the rook

1989
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,359
but is that not ludicrous today to think

1990
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,520
about in in the world of alpha zero

1991
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,720
but alpha zero is jessica so the the

1992
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,240
fundamental question

1993
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:08,880
is how hard is driving compared to chess

1994
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:11,039
because so long term end to end

1995
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,280
will be the right solution the question

1996
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,480
is how many years away is that

1997
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,640
end-to-end is going to be the only

1998
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,039
solution for level five for the only way

1999
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,559
we can

2000
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,079
of course and of course tesla's gonna

2001
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,880
come around to my way and if you're a

2002
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,680
rook guy out there i'm sorry

2003
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,520
the cone guy i don't know we're gonna

2004
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,079
specialize each task we're gonna really

2005
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,119
understand

2006
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,000
rook placement yeah i understand the

2007
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:34,480
intuition you have

2008
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,480
i mean that

2009
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,039
that uh is very compelling notion that

2010
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,400
we can learn the task and to end

2011
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,440
like the same compelling notion you

2012
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,559
might have for natural language

2013
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,880
conversation

2014
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:48,799
i'm not sure

2015
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,640
because one thing you sneaked in there

2016
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:53,119
is the assertion that

2017
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,280
it's impossible to get to level five

2018
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,200
without this kind of approach

2019
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,680
i don't know if that's obvious i don't

2020
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,000
know if that's obvious either i don't

2021
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:03,440
actually uh mean that i think that it is

2022
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,960
much easier

2023
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,799
to get to level five with an end-to-end

2024
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,760
approach i think that the other approach

2025
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,319
is

2026
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,920
doable but the magnitude of the

2027
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,599
engineering challenge may exceed what

2028
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,040
humanity is capable of

2029
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:20,000
so but what do you think of the tesla

2030
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,679
data engine approach which to me is an

2031
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,199
active learning task is kind of

2032
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,960
fascinating

2033
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,319
is breaking it down into these multiple

2034
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,480
tasks and

2035
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,359
mining their data constantly for like

2036
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,199
edge cases

2037
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,560
for these different tasks but the tasks

2038
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:35,359
themselves are not being learned this is

2039
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,359
feature engineering

2040
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,600
yeah i mean it's it's a it's a higher

2041
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,120
abstraction level of feature engineering

2042
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,120
for the different tasks

2043
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,960
it's task engineering in a sense it's

2044
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,480
slightly better feature engineering but

2045
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,279
it still fundamentally is feature

2046
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,440
engineering

2047
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,640
and anything about the history of ai has

2048
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,640
taught us anything

2049
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,880
it's that feature engineering approaches

2050
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,759
will always be replaced and lose

2051
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,080
to end to end now to be fair i cannot

2052
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:04,799
really make promises on timelines

2053
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,239
but i can say that when you look at the

2054
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,960
code for stockfish and the code for

2055
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:09,199
alpha zero

2056
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,719
one is a lot shorter than the other a

2057
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:12,719
lot more elegant required a lot less

2058
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,960
programmer hours to write

2059
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:20,400
yeah but there was a lot more murder

2060
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:24,880
of bad uh

2061
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:28,960
agents on the uh alpha zero side

2062
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,560
by murder i mean uh agents that played a

2063
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,000
game and failed miserably

2064
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:37,040
yeah oh in simulation that failure is

2065
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,799
less costly yeah in in real world it's

2066
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,799
wait do you mean in practice like alpha

2067
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:43,679
zero has lost games miserably

2068
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,960
no well i haven't seen that no but i

2069
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,359
know but the the

2070
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,000
the the requirement for alpha zero is a

2071
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,719
simulator

2072
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,359
to be able to like evolution human

2073
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,040
evolution

2074
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,159
not human evolution biological evolution

2075
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,600
of life on earth from the origin of life

2076
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,640
has murdered trillions upon trillions of

2077
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,360
organisms

2078
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,239
on the path to us humans yeah so the

2079
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,480
question is can

2080
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,159
can we uh stitch together a human-like

2081
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,760
object without having to go through the

2082
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,040
entirety process of evolution

2083
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,880
well no but do the evolution in

2084
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,400
simulation yeah that's the question can

2085
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,159
we simulate so do you have a sense

2086
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,360
that's possible to simulate some

2087
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:22,320
mu zero is exactly this mu zero is

2088
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,840
is the solution to this mu zero i think

2089
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,600
is going to look be looked back

2090
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,360
as the canonical paper and i don't think

2091
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,640
deep learning is everything i think that

2092
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,280
there's still a bunch of things missing

2093
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,800
to get there

2094
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,880
but mu zero i think is going to be

2095
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,760
looked back as the kind of cornerstone

2096
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,960
paper

2097
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,400
um of this whole deep learning era

2098
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,159
and mu zero is the solution to

2099
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,040
self-driving cars you have to make a few

2100
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,960
tweaks to it

2101
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,320
but mu0 does effectively that it does

2102
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,040
those roll outs

2103
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:50,159
and those murdering in in a learned

2104
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,199
simulator in a learned dynamics model

2105
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,120
it's interesting it doesn't get enough

2106
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,719
love i was blown away when i i was blown

2107
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,960
away when i read that paper i'm like

2108
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,000
you know okay i've always had a comma

2109
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,360
i'm gonna sit and i'm gonna wait for the

2110
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,159
solution to self-driving cars to come

2111
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,840
along

2112
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,840
this year i saw it it's me zero yeah

2113
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,040
so uh sit back and let the winning roll

2114
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,679
in

2115
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,159
so your sense just to elaborate a little

2116
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,080
bit

2117
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:16,159
to link on the topic your senses in your

2118
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,800
networks will solve driving

2119
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:20,880
yes like we don't need anything else i

2120
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,800
think the same way chess was maybe the

2121
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,000
chess and maybe google are the pinnacle

2122
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,600
of like

2123
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,040
search algorithms and things that look

2124
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,719
kind of like a star

2125
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:32,080
um the pinnacle of

2126
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,400
this era is going to be self-driving

2127
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,400
cars

2128
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,080
but on the path of that you have to

2129
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,040
deliver products

2130
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,239
and it's possible that the path to full

2131
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,760
self-driving cars

2132
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:47,679
will take decades i doubt it so how long

2133
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,960
would you put on it

2134
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:54,080
like what what are we you're chasing it

2135
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,280
tesla's chasing it what are we talking

2136
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:59,440
about five years 10 years

2137
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:02,960
50 years in the 2020s in the 2020s

2138
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,960
the later part of the 2020s

2139
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,520
with the neural network well that would

2140
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,040
be nice to see and on the path to that

2141
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,800
you're delivering products

2142
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,040
which is a nice l2 system that's what

2143
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,320
tesla's doing a nice l2 system i'm just

2144
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,000
going to do better every time

2145
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,600
l2 the only difference between l2 and

2146
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,840
the other levels is who takes liability

2147
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,280
and

2148
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,640
i'm not a liability guy i want to take

2149
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:27,199
liability level 2 forever

2150
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:29,280
now on that little transition i mean

2151
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,520
how do you make the transition work is

2152
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,080
uh is this where driver sensing

2153
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,719
comes in like how do you make the

2154
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:39,199
because you said

2155
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:41,199
100 miles like is is there some

2156
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,719
sort of human factor psychology thing

2157
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,000
where people start to over trust the

2158
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,000
system all those kinds of

2159
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,360
effects once it gets better and better

2160
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,440
and better and better they get lazier

2161
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,880
and lazier and lazier

2162
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,960
is that like how do you get that

2163
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,480
transition right first off our

2164
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,560
monitoring is already adaptive

2165
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,000
our monitoring is already seen adaptive

2166
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,600
driver monitoring

2167
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,520
is this the camera that's looking at the

2168
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,800
driver you have an infrared camera

2169
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,400
in the our policy for

2170
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,560
how we enforce the driver monitoring is

2171
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,640
scene adaptive what's that mean

2172
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,560
well for example in one of the extreme

2173
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:15,120
cases um

2174
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,760
if you uh if the car is not moving we do

2175
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,800
not

2176
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,920
uh actively enforce driver monitor right

2177
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,080
um if you are going through a

2178
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,120
uh like a 45 mile an hour road with

2179
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,040
lights

2180
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,199
um and stop signs and potentially

2181
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,719
pedestrians we enforce a very tight

2182
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:32,400
driver monitoring policy

2183
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,760
if you are alone on a perfectly straight

2184
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,520
highway

2185
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,880
um and this is it's all machine learning

2186
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,120
none of that is hand coded

2187
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,040
actually the stop is hand coded but so

2188
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,480
there's some kind of machine learning

2189
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:46,239
estimation of risk yes yeah i mean i've

2190
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:50,640
always been a huge fan of that that

2191
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:53,679
that's uh because it's difficult to do

2192
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,440
every step into that direction

2193
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,880
is a worthwhile step to take it might be

2194
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,840
difficult to do really well like us

2195
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,239
humans are able to

2196
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,440
estimate risk pretty damn well whatever

2197
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:04,320
the hell that is

2198
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,679
that feels like one of the nice features

2199
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,239
of us humans

2200
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,239
uh because like we humans are really

2201
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:12,560
good drivers when we're really like

2202
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:14,159
tuned in and we're good at estimating

2203
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,800
risk like when are we supposed to be

2204
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,679
tuned in

2205
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,880
yeah and you know people are like oh

2206
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:20,400
well you know why would you ever make

2207
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,080
the driver monitoring policy

2208
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,840
less aggressive why would you always not

2209
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,960
keep it at its most aggressive

2210
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,800
because then people are just going to

2211
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,280
get fatigued from it yes when they get

2212
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,880
annoyed

2213
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,880
you want them yeah you they want you

2214
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,159
want the experience to be pleasant

2215
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,239
obviously i want the experience to be

2216
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,920
pleasant but even just from a straight

2217
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:38,239
up safety perspective

2218
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,679
if you alert people when they look

2219
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,120
around and they're like

2220
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,880
why is this thing alerting me there's

2221
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,120
nothing i could possibly hit right now

2222
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,880
people will just learn to tune it out

2223
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,239
people will just learn to tune it out to

2224
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,760
put weights on the steering wheel to do

2225
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,480
whatever to overcome it

2226
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,920
and remember that you're always part of

2227
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,679
this adaptive system so

2228
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,120
all i can really say about you know how

2229
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,520
this scale is going forward is yeah

2230
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:01,199
something we have to monitor for

2231
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,040
we don't know this is a great psychology

2232
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,880
experiment at scale like we'll see

2233
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,560
yeah it's fascinating track it and

2234
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,760
making sure you have a good

2235
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,280
understanding of attention is a very key

2236
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,040
part of that psychology problem

2237
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,040
yeah i think i mean you and i probably

2238
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,560
have a different come to it differently

2239
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,800
but to me

2240
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,960
it's an it's a fascinating psychology

2241
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,000
problem to explore something much deeper

2242
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,560
than just driving

2243
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,120
it's a it's such a nice way to explore

2244
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,239
human

2245
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,440
attention and human behavior

2246
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:32,560
which is why again we've probably both

2247
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:35,120
criticized

2248
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,840
mr elon musk on this one topic from

2249
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,760
different

2250
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:43,280
avenues uh so both offline and online i

2251
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,280
had little chats with elon and

2252
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,199
like i love human beings as a as a

2253
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:51,040
as a computer vision problem as an ai

2254
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,640
problem it's fascinating

2255
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:54,400
he wasn't so much interested in that

2256
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,800
problem

2257
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,400
it's like in order to solve driving the

2258
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,199
whole point is you want to remove the

2259
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,440
human from the picture

2260
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:05,600
and it seems like you can't do that

2261
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:09,040
quite yet eventually yes but

2262
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,360
you can't quite do that yet so

2263
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,239
this is the moment where and you can't

2264
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:16,320
yet say

2265
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:18,159
i told you so uh to tesla

2266
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,679
but it's getting there because i don't

2267
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:21,440
know if you've seen this there's some

2268
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,400
reporting that they're in fact starting

2269
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,760
to do

2270
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,920
drive them off yeah they ship the model

2271
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,400
in shadow mode

2272
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,960
uh without uh i believe only a visible

2273
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,280
light camera it might even be fisheye

2274
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,719
uh it's like a low resolution low

2275
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,320
resolution visible light

2276
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,080
i mean to be fair that's what we have in

2277
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,719
the eon as well our last generation

2278
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,040
product

2279
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,480
this is the one area where i can say our

2280
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,000
hardware's ahead of tesla the rest of

2281
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,840
our hardware way way behind but our

2282
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,880
driver monitoring camera

2283
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,280
do you think uh i think on the

2284
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,760
third row tesla podcast or somewhere

2285
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,360
else i've heard you say that

2286
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,120
obviously eventually they're gonna have

2287
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,800
driver monitoring

2288
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,560
i think what i've said is elon will

2289
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,400
definitely ship driver monitoring before

2290
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,679
he ships level five the beautiful level

2291
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,320
and i'm willing to about 10 grand on

2292
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,239
that and you better ground on that

2293
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,679
uh i mean now i want to take the bet but

2294
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,400
before maybe someone would have i should

2295
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,920
have got my money

2296
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:17,120
yeah that's an interesting bet i think i

2297
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:21,600
i think you're right i'm actually

2298
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:25,040
on a human level because he's been

2299
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:27,520
he's made the decision like he said that

2300
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:30,000
driver monitoring is the wrong way to go

2301
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,120
but like you have to think of as a human

2302
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,159
as a ceo

2303
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:37,840
i think that's the right thing to say

2304
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:39,520
when like

2305
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,880
sometimes you have to say things

2306
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,679
publicly they're different than when you

2307
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,760
actually believe

2308
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,360
because when you're producing a large

2309
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,040
number of vehicles

2310
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,640
and the decision was made not to include

2311
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,960
the camera like what are you supposed to

2312
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,600
say

2313
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,440
yeah like our cars don't have the thing

2314
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,560
that i think is right to have

2315
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,800
uh it's an interesting thing but like on

2316
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,000
the other side as a ceo i mean something

2317
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,800
you could probably speak to

2318
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,480
as a leader i think about me as a human

2319
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,000
to publicly change your mind on

2320
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,600
something how hard is that

2321
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,239
well especially when like

2322
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,719
george haas say i told you so

2323
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:16,880
all i will say is i am not a leader and

2324
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:20,159
i am happy to change my mind

2325
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,159
um and i think elon will

2326
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:24,880
yeah i do i think he'll come up with a

2327
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,280
good way to

2328
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,920
make it psychologically okay for him

2329
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,600
well

2330
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,960
it's such an important thing man

2331
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,280
especially for a first principles

2332
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,040
thinker because he made a decision

2333
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,480
that uh driver monitoring is not the

2334
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,520
right way to go and i could see that

2335
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,120
decision

2336
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,280
and i i could even make that decision

2337
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:45,040
like i was on the fence

2338
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:48,159
too like i'm not driving monitoring

2339
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,920
is such an obvious simple solution to

2340
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:51,679
the problem of attention

2341
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,600
it's not obvious to me that just by

2342
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:56,719
putting a camera there you solve

2343
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:59,120
things you have to create an

2344
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:00,719
incredible compelling experience just

2345
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,280
like you're you're talking about

2346
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,040
and i don't know if it's easy to do that

2347
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,920
it's not at all easy to do that in fact

2348
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,280
i think

2349
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,159
so as a creator of a car that's trying

2350
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,239
to

2351
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:14,320
create a product that people love which

2352
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:17,199
is what tesla tries to do right

2353
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,120
it's not obvious to me that uh you know

2354
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,840
as a design decision whether adding a

2355
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,239
camera

2356
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,199
is a good idea from a safety perspective

2357
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:25,840
either like

2358
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,320
in the human factors community everybody

2359
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,920
says

2360
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,640
that like you should obviously have

2361
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:34,400
driver sensing driving monitoring

2362
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:36,640
but like that

2363
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,239
that's like saying it's obvious as

2364
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,920
parents you shouldn't let your kids go

2365
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:43,600
out at night

2366
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,040
but okay but like

2367
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,440
they're still gonna find ways to do

2368
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,440
drugs

2369
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:51,679
yeah you have to also be good parents so

2370
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,719
like it's it's much more complicated

2371
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,719
than just like

2372
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,640
you need to have drive and monitoring i

2373
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,040
totally disagree on

2374
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,400
okay if you have a camera there and the

2375
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,320
camera's watching the person

2376
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,600
but never throws an alert they'll never

2377
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,280
think about it

2378
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:09,199
right the the driver monitoring policy

2379
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,800
that you choose to how you choose to

2380
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:13,199
communicate with the user is

2381
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,120
entirely separate from the data

2382
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:19,760
collection perspective right

2383
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:22,560
right so you know like

2384
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,840
there's one thing to say like you know

2385
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,560
tell your teenager they can't do

2386
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,159
something

2387
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,679
there's another thing to like you know

2388
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,040
gather the data so you can

2389
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,040
make informed decisions that's really

2390
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,199
interesting but you have to make that

2391
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,120
that's the interesting thing about cars

2392
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:37,760
uh but even true with com ai

2393
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,880
like you don't have to manufacture the

2394
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,320
thing into the car

2395
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,920
is you have to make a decision that

2396
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,639
anticipates

2397
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,719
the right strategy long term so like you

2398
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,480
have to start collecting the data

2399
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,000
and start making decisions starter date

2400
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,080
started it three years ago

2401
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,080
i believe that we have the best driver

2402
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,639
monitoring solution in the world

2403
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,000
um i think that when you compare it to

2404
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,600
well supercruise is the only other one

2405
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,360
that i really know that shipped

2406
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,880
and ours is better what uh

2407
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,600
what do you like and not like about

2408
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:11,040
super coos um i mean i had a few

2409
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,920
super crews uh the sun would be shining

2410
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,600
through the window

2411
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,719
would blind the camera and it would say

2412
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,000
i wasn't paying attention when i was

2413
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,760
looking completely straight

2414
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,679
i couldn't reset the attention with a

2415
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,880
steering wheel touch and supercrews

2416
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,320
would disengage

2417
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,400
like i was communicating to the car i'm

2418
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,679
like look i'm here i'm paying attention

2419
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,639
why are you really gonna force me to

2420
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,400
disengage and

2421
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:32,320
it did um so it's it's a constant

2422
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,679
conversation with the user and yeah

2423
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,360
there's no way to ship a system like

2424
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,560
this if you can ota

2425
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,400
right we're shipping a new one every

2426
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,080
month sometimes we we

2427
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,520
balance it with our users on discord

2428
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,800
like when sometimes we make the driver

2429
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,760
monitoring a little more aggressive and

2430
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,760
people complain

2431
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,120
sometimes they don't you know we want it

2432
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,520
to be as aggressive as possible where

2433
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,120
people

2434
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,639
don't complain it doesn't feel intrusive

2435
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,480
so being able to update the system over

2436
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,400
the air is an essential component

2437
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,480
i mean that's probably to me you

2438
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:59,199
mentioned uh

2439
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,880
i mean to me that is the biggest

2440
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:03,520
innovation of tesla

2441
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,719
that it it made it people realize that

2442
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,840
over-the-air updates

2443
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:09,520
is essential yeah i mean

2444
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,040
yeah was that not obvious from the

2445
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,960
iphone the iphone was the first real

2446
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,560
product that ota'ed i think

2447
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,840
was it actually that's that's brilliant

2448
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,880
you're right i mean the game consoles

2449
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,080
used to not right

2450
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,920
the game consoles are maybe the second

2451
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,480
thing that did well i didn't really

2452
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,840
think about

2453
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,400
one of the amazing features of a

2454
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,480
smartphone

2455
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,600
isn't just like the touchscreen isn't

2456
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,560
the thing

2457
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,960
it's the ability to constantly update

2458
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,480
yeah

2459
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,480
get better it gets better

2460
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,360
i love my ios 14. uh

2461
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:43,840
one thing that i probably disagree with

2462
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:46,639
you on on driving monitoring

2463
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:50,159
is you've said that it's easy like i

2464
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:52,639
mean you you tend to say stuff is easy

2465
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:53,840
the uh i guess you said it's easy

2466
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,280
relative to the

2467
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,280
external perception problem

2468
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,239
can you elaborate why you think it's

2469
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,679
easy feature engineering works

2470
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,639
for driver monitoring feature

2471
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,760
engineering does not work for the

2472
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:08,800
external

2473
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:11,199
so human faces are not

2474
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,159
human faces and the movement of human

2475
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,880
faces and head

2476
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:16,080
and body is not as variable as the

2477
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,920
external environment

2478
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,320
is your intuition um yes and there's

2479
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,760
another big difference as well um your

2480
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,400
reliability of a driver monitoring

2481
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,320
system

2482
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,600
doesn't actually need to be that high

2483
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,120
the uncertainty

2484
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,480
if you have something that's detecting

2485
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,679
whether the human is paying attention it

2486
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,440
only works 92

2487
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,040
of the time you're still getting almost

2488
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,880
all the benefit of that because

2489
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,560
the human like you're training the human

2490
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,520
yeah right you're you're dealing with a

2491
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,280
system that's

2492
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,800
really helping you out it's a

2493
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,360
conversation it's not

2494
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,639
like the external thing where guess what

2495
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,600
if you swerve into a tree you swerve

2496
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,239
into a tree

2497
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,760
right like you get no margin for error

2498
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:53,040
yeah i think that's really well put i

2499
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,000
i i think that's the right exactly the

2500
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:58,000
place

2501
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,239
where um where comparing to the external

2502
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,760
perception the control problem

2503
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:05,199
driver monitoring is easier because you

2504
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:07,520
know the bar for success is much lower

2505
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:09,040
yeah but i i still think like the human

2506
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,120
face

2507
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,880
is more complicated actually than the

2508
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,239
external environment but for driving you

2509
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,520
don't give a damn

2510
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:18,159
i don't need you i don't need something

2511
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:21,199
i don't need something that complicated

2512
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:23,120
to to to have to communicate the idea

2513
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,639
to the human that i want to communicate

2514
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,080
which is yo

2515
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,679
system might mess up here you got to pay

2516
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:30,480
attention

2517
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,600
yeah see that's that's my love and

2518
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,800
fascination is the

2519
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:38,400
the human face and it feels like this is

2520
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,920
a nice place to um create products that

2521
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,840
create an experience in the car

2522
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:45,280
so like it feels like there should be

2523
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,000
more richer experiences

2524
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:49,920
in the car you know like that's an

2525
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,080
opportunity for

2526
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,159
like something like my eye or just any

2527
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,080
kind of system like a tesla or any of

2528
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:58,159
the autonomous vehicle companies

2529
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,120
is because software's and there's much

2530
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,639
more sensors

2531
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,719
and so much is running on software and

2532
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,560
you're doing machine learning anyway

2533
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,080
there's an opportunity to create totally

2534
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,239
new experiences

2535
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:10,080
that we're not even anticipating you

2536
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:12,000
don't think so

2537
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,760
no you think it's a box that gets you

2538
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,159
from a to b and you want to do it

2539
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,760
chill yeah i mean i think as soon as we

2540
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:19,120
get to level three on highways okay

2541
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,159
enjoy your candy crush

2542
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,000
enjoy your hulu enjoy your

2543
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,159
you know whatever whatever sure you get

2544
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,840
this you can look at screens basically

2545
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,520
versus right now what do you have music

2546
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,880
and audio books so level three is where

2547
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,330
you can kind of disengage in

2548
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,600
in stretches of time

2549
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,800
[Music]

2550
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,280
[Applause]

2551
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:39,040
well you think level three is possible

2552
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:41,440
like on the highway going for 100 miles

2553
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:44,560
and you can just go to sleep oh yeah

2554
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:47,360
uh sleep so again

2555
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,920
i think it's really all on a spectrum i

2556
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,159
think that

2557
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,280
being able to use your phone while

2558
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:53,840
you're on the highway

2559
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:55,360
and like this all being okay and being

2560
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,960
aware that the car might alert you and

2561
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,320
you have five seconds to basically

2562
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,239
so the five second thing that you think

2563
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,239
is possible yeah i think it is oh yeah

2564
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,679
not not in all scenarios right some

2565
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:05,199
scenarios it's not

2566
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:06,800
it's the whole risk thing that you

2567
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:08,639
mentioned is nice is to be able to

2568
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,560
estimate like

2569
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:12,800
how risky is this situation exactly

2570
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,800
that's really important to understand

2571
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,080
one other thing you mentioned comparing

2572
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,920
comma and

2573
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:22,639
autopilot is that um

2574
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,320
something about the haptic feel of the

2575
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:26,239
way combo controls the car

2576
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,840
when things are uncertain like it

2577
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:29,520
behaves a little bit more uncertain when

2578
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,120
things are uncertain

2579
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,199
that's kind of an interesting point and

2580
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:36,239
then autopilot is much more confident

2581
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:38,719
always even when it's uncertain until it

2582
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:40,960
runs into trouble

2583
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:42,639
yeah that's that's a funny thing i

2584
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,040
actually mentioned that to elon i think

2585
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:46,159
and then the first time we talked he

2586
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,880
wasn't biting

2587
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:51,199
is like communicating uncertainty i

2588
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,280
guess comet doesn't really communicate

2589
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:55,040
uncertainty explicitly communicates it

2590
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,159
through haptic feel

2591
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,840
like what what's the role of

2592
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:00,000
communicating uncertainty do you think

2593
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,280
oh we do some stuff explicitly like we

2594
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,560
do detect the lanes when you're on the

2595
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,239
highway and we'll show you how many

2596
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,440
lanes we're using to drive with

2597
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:07,760
you can look at where it thinks the

2598
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:09,920
lanes are you can look at um

2599
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,360
the path and yeah we want to be better

2600
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,120
about this we're actually hiring

2601
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,560
i want to hire some new ui people ui

2602
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,120
people you mentioned this because it's

2603
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,199
such an

2604
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,199
it's a ui problem too right it's we're

2605
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:20,400
we have a great designer now

2606
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,600
but you know we need people who are just

2607
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,239
gonna like build this and debug these

2608
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,360
uis

2609
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:26,320
qt people and okay is that what the ui

2610
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,600
has done with this key

2611
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:32,159
we're moving the new ui is in qt c plus

2612
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:35,520
plus qt

2613
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:37,760
uses it yeah we had some react stuff in

2614
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,159
there

2615
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,040
react js would just react react is his

2616
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:43,040
own language right

2617
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,400
react native reaction react to the

2618
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,000
javascript framework

2619
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,600
yeah it's all it's all based on

2620
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,280
javascript but it's

2621
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:54,400
you know i like c plus plus

2622
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,040
what do you think about uh dojo with

2623
01:27:54,400 --> 01:28:00,159
tesla

2624
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:02,320
and their foray into what appears to be

2625
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:04,880
specialized hardware for uh training

2626
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,880
neonets

2627
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,400
i guess it's something maybe you can

2628
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,400
correct me from my

2629
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:12,239
shallow looking at it it seems like

2630
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,040
something like google did with tpus but

2631
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:16,000
specialized

2632
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,320
for uh driving data i don't think it's

2633
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,480
specialized for driving data

2634
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:22,560
it's just legit just tpu they want to

2635
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,719
inter go the apple way basically

2636
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:27,120
everything required in the chain is done

2637
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,000
in-house well so you have a problem

2638
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:31,760
right now and

2639
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,719
this is one of my one of my concerns i

2640
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,480
really would like to see

2641
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,320
somebody deal with this if anyone out

2642
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,360
there is doing it i'd like to help them

2643
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,520
if i can

2644
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,679
um you basically have two options right

2645
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:45,600
now to train

2646
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:45,600
your options are nvidia or google

2647
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,920
so google is not even an option

2648
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,040
their tpus are only available in google

2649
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,360
cloud

2650
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,040
google has absolutely onerous terms of

2651
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,600
service restrictions

2652
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,800
uh they may have changed it but back in

2653
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,400
google's terms of service it said

2654
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,600
explicitly you are not allowed to use

2655
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,520
google cloud ml

2656
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,199
for training autonomous vehicles or for

2657
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,320
doing anything that competes with google

2658
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,199
without google's prior written

2659
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,280
permission

2660
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:12,800
well okay i mean google is not a

2661
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,600
platform company

2662
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,639
uh i wouldn't i wouldn't touch tpus with

2663
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,120
a 10-foot pole

2664
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,960
so that leaves you with the monopoly uh

2665
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,639
nvidia and video

2666
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:28,400
so i mean that you're not a fan of well

2667
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:31,760
look i was a huge fan of in 2016 nvidia

2668
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:35,120
jensen came sat in the car um

2669
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:38,239
cool guy when the stock was 30 a share

2670
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:39,280
uh nvidia stock has skyrocketed i

2671
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,199
witnessed a real

2672
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:43,440
change in who was in management over

2673
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:46,880
there in like 2018

2674
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:48,480
and now they are let's exploit let's

2675
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,440
take every dollar we possibly can out of

2676
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,960
this ecosystem

2677
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,639
let's charge ten thousand dollars for

2678
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,080
a100s because we know we got the best

2679
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:56,560
 in the game

2680
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:57,760
and let's charge ten thousand dollars

2681
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,360
for an a100

2682
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,159
when it's really not that different from

2683
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:05,120
3080 which is 699.

2684
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:06,400
um the margins that they are making off

2685
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,520
of those high-end chips are

2686
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,639
so high that i mean i think they're

2687
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,080
shooting themselves in the foot just

2688
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,520
from a business perspective

2689
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:16,000
because there's a lot of people talking

2690
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,800
like me now who are like somebody's got

2691
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,800
taken video down

2692
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,320
yeah where they could dominate it nvidia

2693
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:25,360
could be the new intel

2694
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:26,880
yeah to be in inside everything

2695
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:30,080
essentially

2696
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,120
and and yet the winners in in certain

2697
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:34,080
spaces like

2698
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,199
autonomous driving the winners only the

2699
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,880
people who are like

2700
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:38,400
desperately falling back and trying to

2701
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,560
catch up and have a ton of money

2702
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,960
like the big automakers are the ones

2703
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,480
interested in partnering with nvidia

2704
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,080
oh and then i think a lot of those

2705
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,280
things are going to fall through if i

2706
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,880
were nvidia

2707
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:52,080
sell chips sell chips at a reasonable

2708
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,239
markup

2709
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,000
to everybody to everybody without any

2710
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:58,639
restrictions without any restrictions

2711
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,840
intel did this look at intel they had a

2712
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,600
great long run

2713
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,080
nvidia is trying to turn their they're

2714
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,960
like trying to productize their chips

2715
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:09,360
way too much they're trying to extract

2716
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,960
way more value than they can sustainably

2717
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,560
sure you can do it tomorrow is it going

2718
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,520
to up your share price sure if you're

2719
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,800
one of those ceos

2720
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,719
like how much can i strip mine this

2721
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,760
company and you know and that's what's

2722
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:19,440
weird about it too

2723
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,199
like the ceo is the founder it's the

2724
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:24,320
same guy yeah i mean i still think

2725
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:25,120
jensen's a great guy that's great why do

2726
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,520
this

2727
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,719
you have a choice you have a choice

2728
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,560
right now are you trying to cash out are

2729
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,280
you trying to buy a yacht

2730
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,080
if you are fine but if you're trying to

2731
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,320
be

2732
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,120
the next huge semiconductor company sell

2733
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,719
chips

2734
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,880
well the the interesting thing about

2735
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:44,239
jensen is he is

2736
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:48,639
a big vision guy so he has

2737
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:50,639
a plan like for 50 years down the road

2738
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,480
so it makes me wonder like how does

2739
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:53,040
price gouging fit into it yeah how does

2740
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,760
that

2741
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,960
like it's it doesn't seem to make sense

2742
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,800
to plan

2743
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:01,120
i worry that he's listening to the wrong

2744
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:04,480
people yeah that that's the sense i have

2745
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:05,120
too sometimes because i despite

2746
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,960
everything

2747
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:09,840
i think nvidia is an incredible company

2748
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,320
well one

2749
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,920
sort of i'm deeply grateful to nvidia

2750
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,800
for the products they've created me to

2751
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,080
pass right

2752
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,880
and so the 1080 ti was a great gpu still

2753
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:22,320
have a lot of them

2754
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:26,800
it was yeah but

2755
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:28,080
at the same time it just feels like

2756
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,560
feels like you don't want to put all

2757
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:32,960
your stock in nvidia and so like elon

2758
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,960
is doing um what tesla is doing with

2759
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,679
autopilot and dojo

2760
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:40,080
is the apple way is because they're not

2761
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,480
going to share dojo with uh george hotz

2762
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,520
uh

2763
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:45,040
i i know they should sell that chip

2764
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,040
oh they should sell their even their

2765
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:49,040
their accelerator the accelerator that's

2766
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:52,639
in all the cars the 30 watt one

2767
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:54,719
sell it why not so open it up

2768
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,679
make me why does this have to be a car

2769
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,440
company

2770
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,800
well if you sell the chip here's what

2771
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,480
you get yeah

2772
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,920
make some money off the chips it doesn't

2773
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,960
take away from your chip

2774
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,040
you're going to make some money free

2775
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,280
money and also

2776
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,880
the world is going to build an ecosystem

2777
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,239
of tooling for you

2778
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,639
right you're not going to have to fix

2779
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:15,280
the bug in your tanh layer

2780
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:16,639
someone else already did well the

2781
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,360
question that's an interesting question

2782
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,880
i mean that's the

2783
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:21,040
question steve jobs asked that's the

2784
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:25,040
question elon musk is

2785
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:26,880
uh perhaps asking is uh

2786
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,560
do you want tesla stuff inside other

2787
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,600
vehicles in

2788
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,560
inside potentially inside like uh irobot

2789
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,760
vacuum cleaner

2790
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,199
yeah i think you should decide where

2791
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,320
your advantages are

2792
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:40,239
i'm not saying tesla should start

2793
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,760
selling battery packs to automakers

2794
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,520
because battery packs to automakers they

2795
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,800
are straight up in competition with you

2796
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,120
if i were tesla i'd keep the battery

2797
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,840
technology totally yeah ssr's we make

2798
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:51,360
batteries

2799
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:53,520
but the thing about the tesla tpu um

2800
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,480
is anybody can build that it's just a

2801
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,800
question of you know

2802
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,480
are you willing to spend the you know

2803
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,000
the money it could be a huge source of

2804
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,040
revenue potentially

2805
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,679
are you willing to spend 100 million

2806
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,440
dollars right anyone can build it

2807
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,800
and someone will and a bunch of

2808
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,480
companies now are starting trying to

2809
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,159
build ai accelerators somebody's going

2810
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:13,600
to get the idea right

2811
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:14,960
and yeah hopefully they don't get greedy

2812
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,400
because they'll just lose to the next

2813
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,520
guy who finally and then eventually the

2814
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,440
chinese are going to make knock off and

2815
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,639
video chips and that's

2816
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,480
from your perspective i don't know if

2817
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:23,840
you're also paying attention to stan

2818
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,639
tesla for a moment

2819
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,719
all dave elon musk has talked about a

2820
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,520
complete rewrite

2821
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,400
of uh the neural net that they're using

2822
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,120
that seems to

2823
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,639
again i'm half paying attention but it

2824
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,120
seems to involve

2825
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:42,080
basically a kind of integration of all

2826
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:44,320
the sensors to where

2827
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,520
it's a four dimensional view you know

2828
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,840
you have a 3d

2829
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:49,840
model of the world over time and then

2830
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:53,199
you can i think it's done

2831
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:55,679
both for the for actually you know

2832
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:57,679
so the neural network is able to in a

2833
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,199
more holistic way deal with the world

2834
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:02,000
and make predictions and so on

2835
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:03,679
but also to make the annotation task

2836
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,080
more uh

2837
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:07,199
you know easier like you can annotate

2838
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,119
the world

2839
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:10,880
in one place and then kind of distribute

2840
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:13,679
itself across the sensors and

2841
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,119
across a different like the hundreds of

2842
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:18,080
tasks that are involved

2843
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:19,920
in the hydronet what are your thoughts

2844
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,199
about this rewrite is it just like some

2845
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,880
details

2846
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:24,320
that are kind of obvious there are steps

2847
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,000
that should be taken or is there

2848
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,760
something fundamental

2849
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,719
that could challenge your idea that end

2850
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,159
to end is the right solution

2851
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,679
uh we're in the middle of a bakery right

2852
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,800
now as well we haven't shipped a new

2853
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,199
model in a bit

2854
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,159
of what kind uh we're going from 2d to

2855
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,600
3d

2856
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:41,440
right now all our stuff like for example

2857
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,719
when the car pitches back the lane lines

2858
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,040
also pitch back

2859
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,560
uh because we're assuming the flat ro

2860
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,560
flat world hypothesis

2861
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,480
uh the new models do not do this the new

2862
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,960
models output everything in 3d

2863
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:54,639
um so this but there's still no

2864
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:57,920
annotation so the 3d is

2865
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:59,679
it's more about the opposite yeah uh

2866
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,119
we have we have disease and everything

2867
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,360
uh we've disease

2868
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:04,960
yeah we had a disease we had a disease

2869
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,880
um we unified

2870
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,880
a lot of stuff as well uh we switched

2871
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,920
from tensorflow to pi torch

2872
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:14,239
yes uh my understanding

2873
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,080
of what tesla's thing is is that their

2874
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:17,920
annotator now annotates across the time

2875
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:21,840
dimension

2876
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,880
uh i mean cute

2877
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:28,159
why are you building an annotator i i

2878
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:30,880
find their entire pipeline

2879
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:31,600
i find your vision i mean the vision

2880
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,920
event to end

2881
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,920
very compelling but i also like the

2882
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,360
engineering of the data engine that

2883
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:40,159
they've created

2884
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,440
in terms of supervised learning

2885
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:44,080
pipelines

2886
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,960
that thing is damn impressive you're

2887
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:48,000
basically the

2888
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:50,080
the idea is that you have hundreds of

2889
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,679
thousands of people that are doing data

2890
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,440
collection for you by doing their

2891
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:55,119
experience so that's kind of similar to

2892
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:58,239
the common ai model

2893
01:36:55,119 --> 01:37:00,800
and you're able to

2894
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:02,800
mine that data based on the kind of edge

2895
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,840
cases you need

2896
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,280
i i think it's harder to do in the end

2897
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,520
to end learning

2898
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:11,360
the mining of the right edge cases like

2899
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:15,199
that's where feature engineering

2900
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:17,600
is actually really powerful because

2901
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:20,000
like us humans are able to do this kind

2902
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,840
of mining a little better but but

2903
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,040
yeah there's obvious as we as we know

2904
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,159
there's obvious constraints and

2905
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:27,280
limitations to that

2906
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:28,080
idea uh carpathi just tweeted he's like

2907
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,679
um

2908
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:32,000
you get really interesting insights if

2909
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,520
you saw if you sort your validation set

2910
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,320
by loss

2911
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,040
and look at the highest loss examples

2912
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,320
yeah

2913
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:41,840
uh so yeah i mean you can do we we have

2914
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,679
we have a little data engine like thing

2915
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,880
we're training a segment uh

2916
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:48,159
it's not fancy it's just like okay train

2917
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,400
the new segment

2918
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:52,000
run it on 100 000 images and now take

2919
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:54,480
the thousand with highest loss

2920
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
select 100 of those by human put those

2921
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:59,440
get those ones labeled

2922
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,840
retrain do it again right so it's a much

2923
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:03,280
less well-written data engine and yeah

2924
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,719
you can you can take these things really

2925
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,840
far and it is

2926
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:09,760
impressive engineering and if you truly

2927
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,199
need supervised data for a problem

2928
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:14,159
yeah things like data engine are the

2929
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:15,440
high end of the

2930
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:17,360
what is attention is a human paying

2931
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:18,560
attention i mean we're going to probably

2932
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,920
build something that looks like data

2933
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,639
engine to push our driver monitoring

2934
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,280
further

2935
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,480
um but for driving itself you have it

2936
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,800
all annotated beautifully

2937
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,920
by what the human does so yeah that's

2938
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,480
interesting i mean that applies to

2939
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,719
driver

2940
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:32,159
attention as well do you want to detect

2941
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,440
the eyes do you want to detect blinking

2942
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:36,000
and pupil movement

2943
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:37,920
do you want to detect all the like face

2944
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,639
alignments the landmark detection and so

2945
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,040
on

2946
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,239
and then doing kind of reasoning based

2947
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,000
on that or do you want to take the

2948
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:47,040
entirety of the face over time and

2949
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,719
do and i mean it's obvious that over

2950
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,320
eventually you have to do end to end

2951
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:51,280
with some calibration with some fixes

2952
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:54,560
and so on

2953
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,679
but it's uh like i don't know when

2954
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,159
that's the right move

2955
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,040
even if it's end to end there actually

2956
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:02,400
is there is no

2957
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,280
kind of um you have to supervise that

2958
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,119
with humans

2959
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,760
whether a human is paying attention or

2960
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:10,000
not is a completely subjective judgment

2961
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,600
um like you can try to like

2962
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
automatically do it with some stuff but

2963
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,119
you don't

2964
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
have if i record a video of a human i

2965
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:18,320
don't have

2966
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,520
true annotations anywhere in that video

2967
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:22,080
the only way to get them

2968
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,719
is with you know other humans labeling

2969
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:26,000
it really

2970
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:29,199
well i don't know uh you you so

2971
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,560
if you think deeply about it you could

2972
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,159
you might be able to just depending on

2973
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,159
the task maybe you'll discover

2974
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:36,239
self-annotating things like

2975
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:37,600
you know you can look at like steering

2976
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:39,600
wheel reversal or something like that

2977
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,119
you can discover little moments of lapse

2978
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:44,000
of attention yeah

2979
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:44,560
i mean that's that's where psychology

2980
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,560
comes in

2981
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,920
is there indicate because you have so so

2982
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,400
much data to look at

2983
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,320
so you might be able to find moments

2984
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,320
when there's like just

2985
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:56,080
inattention that even with smartphone if

2986
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:58,000
you want to detect smartphone use

2987
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:59,360
yeah you can start to zoom in i mean

2988
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
that's the gold mine

2989
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,520
sort of the comma ai i mean tesla's

2990
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,440
doing this too right is there they're

2991
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,000
doing

2992
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:09,600
annotation based on it's like uh

2993
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,520
self-supervised

2994
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,119
learning too it's just a small part of

2995
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,159
the entire picture

2996
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:18,639
it's that's kind of the challenge

2997
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:20,840
of solving a problem in machine learning

2998
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:23,920
if you can discover

2999
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,320
self-annotating parts of the problem

3000
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:28,080
right our driver monitoring team is half

3001
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,400
a person right now i have a problem

3002
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,920
you know once we have skill to full once

3003
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,119
we have two people once we have two

3004
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,239
three people on that team

3005
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,920
i definitely want to look at

3006
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:38,000
self-annotating stuff or yeah for

3007
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:41,840
attention

3008
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,400
let's go back for a sec to uh to a comma

3009
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,239
and how what you know for people who are

3010
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,840
curious to try it out

3011
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:50,960
how do you install a comma in say a 2020

3012
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,719
toyota corolla

3013
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,159
or like what are the cars that are

3014
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:55,440
supported what are the cars that you

3015
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:58,239
recommend

3016
01:40:55,440 --> 01:41:00,000
and what does it take you have a few

3017
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:00,880
videos out but maybe through words can

3018
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,239
you explain

3019
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,880
what's it take to actually install a

3020
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:05,280
thing so we support uh i think it's 91

3021
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,880
cars

3022
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:10,080
91 makes models um we get to 100 this

3023
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:13,119
year

3024
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:16,639
nice the yeah the

3025
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:20,159
2020 corolla great choice

3026
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:22,000
the um 2020 sonata uh it's using the

3027
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:23,119
stock longitudinal it's using just our

3028
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,119
lateral control

3029
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:26,560
but it's a very refined car their

3030
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:30,159
longitudinal control is not

3031
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:33,360
bad at all um so yeah corolla

3032
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:34,480
sonata or if you're willing to get your

3033
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,239
hands a little dirty and look in the

3034
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,360
right places on the internet the honda

3035
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,960
civic is great

3036
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,400
uh but you're going to have to install a

3037
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,159
modified eps firmware

3038
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,520
in order to get a little bit more torque

3039
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:45,280
and i can't help you with that comma

3040
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,840
does not officially endorse that

3041
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,040
um but we have been doing it we didn't

3042
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,639
ever release it

3043
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,719
uh we waited for someone else to

3044
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:54,639
discover it and then you know

3045
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,440
and you have a discord server where

3046
01:41:54,639 --> 01:42:00,320
people there's a very active

3047
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:01,440
developer community yeah as opposed to

3048
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,400
so

3049
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,800
depending on the level of

3050
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:08,159
experimentation you're willing to

3051
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:09,600
to do that's the community if you

3052
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:12,400
if you just want to buy it and you have

3053
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,480
a supported car yeah it's

3054
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,840
10 minutes to install there's youtube

3055
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:17,760
videos it's

3056
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,880
ikea furniture level if you can set up a

3057
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,239
table from ikea

3058
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,480
you can install a comma 2 in your

3059
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:23,920
supported car and it will just work

3060
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,679
now you're like oh but i want this

3061
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,080
high-end feature or i want to fix this

3062
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:27,440
bug

3063
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,440
okay well welcome to the developer

3064
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:31,520
community uh

3065
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:33,119
so what if i wanted to this is something

3066
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,520
i asked you offline

3067
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:38,239
or like a few months ago if i wanted to

3068
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:42,639
run my own code

3069
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:44,800
to um so use comma as a

3070
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,920
platform and try to run something like

3071
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,400
open pilot

3072
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,159
what does it take to do that um so

3073
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,679
there's a toggle in the settings called

3074
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:54,000
enable ssh

3075
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:55,600
and if you toggle that you can ssh into

3076
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,840
your device you can modify the code you

3077
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:59,520
can upload whatever code you want to it

3078
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,000
um there's a whole lot of people so

3079
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,040
about 60 of people are running stock

3080
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,400
comma

3081
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,880
about 40 percent of people are running

3082
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:08,960
forks and there's a community

3083
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,800
of there's a bunch of people who

3084
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,679
maintain these forks and these forks

3085
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,639
support

3086
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,679
different cars or they have you know uh

3087
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,199
different toggles

3088
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:18,800
we try to keep away from the toggles

3089
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:19,280
that are like disabled driver monitoring

3090
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,880
but

3091
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:22,159
you know there's some people might want

3092
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,480
that kind of thing and like you know

3093
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:27,600
yeah you can it's your car it's your

3094
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:30,960
i'm not here to tell you you know

3095
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:32,480
uh we we have some you know we ban

3096
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,600
if you're trying to subvert safety

3097
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:35,119
features you're banned from our discord

3098
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,840
i don't want anything to do with you

3099
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:39,679
but there's some forks doing that you

3100
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,800
got it

3101
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:44,960
so you encourage responsible uh forking

3102
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,040
yeah yeah some people you know yeah some

3103
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,520
people uh like like there's forks that

3104
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,520
will do

3105
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:52,480
um some people just like having a lot of

3106
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,000
uh readouts on the ui like a lot of like

3107
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,800
flashing numbers so there's forks that

3108
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,400
do that

3109
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,840
uh some people don't like the fact that

3110
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:00,400
it disengages when you press the gas

3111
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:03,360
pedal there's forks that disable that

3112
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,000
got it now the the stock experience is

3113
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:06,239
is what

3114
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,080
like so it does both lane keeping and

3115
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:09,760
longitudinal control

3116
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,119
all together so it's not separate like

3117
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:14,000
it is an autopilot

3118
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:15,280
no so okay um some cars we use the stock

3119
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,040
longitudinal control we don't do the

3120
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,960
longitudinal control on all the cars

3121
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:20,320
uh some cars the acc's are pretty good

3122
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,600
in the cars it's the lane keep that's

3123
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,280
atrocious in anything except for

3124
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:27,040
autopilot super cruise

3125
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:28,960
but you know you just turn it on and it

3126
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:31,280
it works what does this engagement look

3127
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:32,800
like yeah so we have i mean i'm very

3128
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:36,000
concerned about mode confusion

3129
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:37,280
i've experienced it on supercruise and

3130
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,679
and autopilot where

3131
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:42,239
like autopilot like autopilot disengages

3132
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:44,639
i don't realize that the acc is still on

3133
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:46,320
the lead car moves slightly over and

3134
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:48,000
then the tesla accelerates to like

3135
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,480
whatever my set speed is super fast and

3136
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,840
like

3137
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:54,080
what's going on here um we have

3138
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,840
engaged and disengaged and this is

3139
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,760
similar to my understanding i'm not a

3140
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,880
pilot but my understanding is either the

3141
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,119
pilot

3142
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,000
is in control or the co-pilot is in

3143
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:04,080
control

3144
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,880
and we have the same kind of transition

3145
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:08,480
system either open pilot is engaged or

3146
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,639
open pilot is disengaged

3147
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:13,119
engage with cruise control disengage

3148
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:15,520
with either gas break or cancel

3149
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:17,360
let's talk about money what's uh the

3150
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:21,119
business strategy for comma

3151
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:24,320
profitable well it's you're good

3152
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:26,320
so congratulations yeah uh what uh

3153
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,840
so basically selling so we should say

3154
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:30,480
combo cost uh

3155
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,080
a thousand bucks comment 200 for the

3156
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:34,239
interface to the car as well it's 1200

3157
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:36,480
all said done

3158
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,600
nobody's usually up front like this yeah

3159
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:40,080
you got it you got to have the tac

3160
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:41,040
on right yeah i love it this side i'm

3161
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,520
not going to lie to you

3162
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,239
trust me it will add 1200 value to your

3163
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,320
life yes

3164
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:48,239
it's still super cheap 30 days no

3165
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:50,480
questions asked money back guarantee and

3166
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:52,080
prices are only going up you know if

3167
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,040
there ever is future hardware

3168
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,719
it could cost a lot more than twelve

3169
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:56,400
hundred dollars so comma three is in the

3170
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:59,199
works

3171
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:00,719
so it could be all i will say is future

3172
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:02,800
hardware is going to cost a lot more

3173
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:05,119
than the current hardware

3174
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,880
yeah like i mean the people that use uh

3175
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:07,840
the people i've spoken with that use

3176
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:10,719
comma

3177
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:12,080
use open pilot they first of all they

3178
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,920
use it a lot

3179
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,520
so people that use it they they fall in

3180
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,639
love with oh our retention rate is

3181
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,480
insane

3182
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:19,679
this is a good sign yeah it's a really

3183
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:23,040
good sign um

3184
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,679
70 of comma 2 buyers are daily active

3185
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,800
users

3186
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:29,199
yeah it's amazing

3187
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,480
um oh also we don't plan on stopping

3188
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:33,040
selling the comma too

3189
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:36,560
like like it's you know so whatever you

3190
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:39,520
create that's beyond comma two

3191
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,639
it would be uh it would be potentially a

3192
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,639
phase shift

3193
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:44,560
like it's you it's so much better that

3194
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,040
like you could use comma two and you can

3195
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,560
use

3196
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:48,239
comma depends what you want it's three

3197
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,800
point four one kind of 42

3198
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:52,480
yeah you know autopilot hardware one

3199
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,080
versus hardware two yeah the comma two

3200
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,040
is kind of like hardware one got it got

3201
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,040
it

3202
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:58,639
got it got it i think i heard you talk

3203
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:00,639
about retention rate with the

3204
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,880
vr headsets that the average is just

3205
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:04,400
once yeah which is fast i mean it's such

3206
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,679
a fascinating way to think about

3207
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,360
technology

3208
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,400
and this is a really really good sign

3209
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,760
and the other thing that people say

3210
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,040
about comm is like they can't believe

3211
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,920
they're getting this for a thousand

3212
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,800
bucks

3213
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:16,960
right it's it seems it seems like a some

3214
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,040
kind of steal

3215
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:21,280
so but in terms of like long-term

3216
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:24,000
business strategies it basically to

3217
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:26,719
put so it's currently in like a thousand

3218
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,719
plus cars

3219
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:34,719
1200 more uh

3220
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:36,800
so yeah dailies is about uh

3221
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:38,880
dailies is about 2 000 weekly is about 2

3222
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:41,280
500. monthlies is over 3 000.

3223
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,080
wow we've grown a lot since we've

3224
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,400
stopped

3225
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:46,159
is the goal like can we talk crazy for a

3226
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:49,199
second i mean what's the

3227
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:51,280
goal to overtake tesla let's talk

3228
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:54,080
okay so i mean android did overtake ios

3229
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,920
yeah that's exactly it right so

3230
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:57,199
yeah they did it i actually don't know

3231
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,400
the timeline of that one

3232
01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:02,159
they but let let's talk uh

3233
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:04,000
because everything is in alpha now the

3234
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,639
autopilot you could argue is in alpha in

3235
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,400
terms of

3236
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:09,040
towards the big mission of autonomous

3237
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:11,600
driving right and so

3238
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:13,280
what yes your goal to overtake into

3239
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,840
millions of cars

3240
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,639
essentially of course where would it

3241
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,159
stop

3242
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,679
like it's open source software it might

3243
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:21,199
not be millions of cars with a piece of

3244
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:24,239
comma hardware but yeah

3245
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:26,880
i think open pilot at some point

3246
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:29,040
will cross over autopilot in in users

3247
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:32,080
just like android crossed over ios

3248
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:35,040
how does google make money from android

3249
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:37,280
uh it's it's complicated their own

3250
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:39,840
devices make money

3251
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:41,760
google google makes money by just kind

3252
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,480
of having you on the internet

3253
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,440
uh yes google search is built in gmail

3254
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,880
is built in

3255
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,800
android is just a shill for the rest of

3256
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,520
google's ecosystem yeah but the problem

3257
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:52,400
is

3258
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,280
android is not is a brilliant thing i

3259
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:55,760
mean

3260
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,639
android arguably changed the world so

3261
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:00,000
there you go that's

3262
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:03,440
you can you can feel good ethically

3263
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:05,920
speaking but as a business strategy it's

3264
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,119
questionable i'll sell hardware so

3265
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,320
hardware i mean it took google a long

3266
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:10,080
time to come around to it but they are

3267
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:12,480
now making money on the pixel

3268
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:14,080
you're not about money you're more about

3269
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:16,639
winning yeah of course

3270
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:18,239
but if only if only 10 percent of open

3271
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:20,719
pilot devices

3272
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:22,159
come from comma ai we still make a lot

3273
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:23,599
that is still yes that is a ton of money

3274
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,000
for our company but can't somebody

3275
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,119
create

3276
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,320
a better comma using open pilot or

3277
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,360
you're basically saying well i'll

3278
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,199
compete well i'll compete

3279
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,560
is can you create a better android phone

3280
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:35,520
than the google pixel right

3281
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,480
i mean you can but like i love that so

3282
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,239
you're confident

3283
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,920
like you know what the hell you're doing

3284
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:43,679
yeah it's

3285
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:44,880
it's uh confidence in merit i mean our

3286
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:46,080
money yeah our money comes from we're a

3287
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,560
consumer electronics company

3288
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:50,639
yeah and put it this way so we sold we

3289
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:54,840
sold like three thousand company's

3290
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:58,560
um i'm 2500 right now uh

3291
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:00,239
and like

3292
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,960
okay we're probably going to sell 10 000

3293
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:04,400
units next year right 10 000 units

3294
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,800
even just a thousand dollars a unit okay

3295
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:09,840
we're 10 million in uh

3296
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,719
in in in in revenue um get that up to a

3297
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,159
hundred thousand

3298
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:13,199
maybe double the price of the unit now

3299
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:13,920
we're talking like 200 million in

3300
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:17,280
revenue yeah

3301
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,880
actually making money uh one of the rare

3302
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,400
semi-autonomous or autonomous vehicle

3303
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,599
companies that are actually making

3304
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:25,360
money yeah yeah you know

3305
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,159
if you have if you look at a model when

3306
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,440
we were just talking about this

3307
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,719
yesterday if you look at a model

3308
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,639
and like you're testing like you're a b

3309
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:31,119
testing your model and if you're you're

3310
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,960
you're

3311
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:34,800
one branch of the a b test the losses go

3312
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,199
down very fast in the first five epochs

3313
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,520
yeah

3314
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:38,960
that model is probably going to converge

3315
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,159
to something considerably better than

3316
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,280
the one where the losses are going down

3317
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,480
slower

3318
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:44,159
why do people think this is going to

3319
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:45,520
stop why do people think one day there's

3320
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:47,599
going to be a great like

3321
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,440
well waymo's eventually going to surpass

3322
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:52,960
you guys

3323
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:53,679
no they're not you see like a world

3324
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,880
where like

3325
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:57,280
a tesla or a car like a tesla would be

3326
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,760
able to

3327
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:01,920
basically press a button and you like

3328
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,480
switch to open pilot

3329
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,199
you know you know they load in i don't

3330
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,280
know so

3331
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:08,560
i think so first off i think that we may

3332
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:11,199
surpass tesla

3333
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:12,719
in terms of users uh i do not think

3334
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:13,360
we're gonna surpass tesla ever in terms

3335
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,800
of revenue

3336
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,960
i think tesla can capture a lot more

3337
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:19,679
revenue per user than we can

3338
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,400
um but this mimics the android ios model

3339
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,159
exactly

3340
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,280
there may be more android devices but

3341
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:24,159
you know there's a lot more iphones than

3342
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,679
google pixels

3343
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:28,639
so i think there'll be a lot more tesla

3344
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:32,880
cars sold than pieces of comma hardware

3345
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:35,280
um and then as far as a

3346
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,159
tesla owner being able to switch to open

3347
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:40,960
pilot

3348
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:43,280
uh does ios does iphones run android

3349
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,480
no but you can if you really want to do

3350
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,199
it but it doesn't really make sense like

3351
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,800
it's not

3352
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:50,320
it doesn't make sense who cares what

3353
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:53,280
about if uh a large company like

3354
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:54,560
automakers 4g m toyota came to george

3355
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:57,920
hotz or

3356
01:51:54,560 --> 01:52:01,040
on the tech space amazon facebook google

3357
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:04,639
came with a large pile of cash

3358
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:07,199
would would you consider being

3359
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:07,199
purchased

3360
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,760
do you see that as a one possible not

3361
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:15,040
seriously now

3362
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:18,239
um i would probably uh

3363
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:19,199
see how much uh they'll entertain

3364
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:20,800
for me

3365
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:22,880
um and if they're willing to like jump

3366
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,800
through a bunch of my hoops then maybe

3367
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,480
but like no not the way that m a works

3368
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,000
today i mean we've been approached

3369
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:30,880
and i laugh in these people's faces i'm

3370
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,560
like are you kidding me

3371
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,719
yeah you know because you're so it's so

3372
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,679
it's so demeaning the m a people are

3373
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:38,719
so demeaning to companies they treat the

3374
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:41,440
startup world

3375
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:42,719
as their innovation ecosystem and they

3376
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,199
think that i'm cool with going along

3377
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:44,960
with that

3378
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:47,440
so i can have some of their scam fake

3379
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:49,199
fed dollars you know fedcoin i don't

3380
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:51,280
what am i gonna do with more fedcoin you

3381
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:53,040
know i had coin fat coin man

3382
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:55,280
i love that so that's the cool thing

3383
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:56,560
about podcasting actually is uh

3384
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,800
people criticize i don't know if you're

3385
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,760
familiar with the spotify

3386
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:03,679
uh giving joe rogan a hundred million

3387
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:07,199
and something about that

3388
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:08,480
and you know they respect

3389
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:11,360
despite all the that people are

3390
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:14,239
talking about spotify

3391
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:15,199
people understand that podcasters like

3392
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:17,199
joe rogan

3393
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:18,480
know what the hell they're doing yeah so

3394
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:21,760
they give them money

3395
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:24,719
and say just do what you do and

3396
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:25,360
like the equivalent for you would be

3397
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,119
like

3398
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:29,520
george do what the hell you do because

3399
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:30,320
you're good at it try not to murder too

3400
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,239
many people

3401
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,760
like try like there's some kind of

3402
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:37,360
common sense things like

3403
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:39,440
just don't go on a weird rampage of

3404
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:40,639
yeah it comes down to what companies i

3405
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:44,400
could respect

3406
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:45,199
right um you know could i respect gm

3407
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:48,960
never

3408
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:49,440
um no i couldn't i mean could i respect

3409
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,960
like

3410
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:54,560
a hyundai more so right that's that's a

3411
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:58,239
lot closer toyota

3412
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:59,280
what's your nah nah it's korean is the

3413
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,400
way

3414
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:02,400
i think i think that you know the

3415
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,719
japanese the germans the us they're all

3416
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,639
too

3417
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,400
they're all too you know they all think

3418
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:07,440
they're too great what about the tech

3419
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,239
companies

3420
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:12,159
apple apple is of the tech companies

3421
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:14,320
that i could respect apple's the closest

3422
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:15,360
yeah i mean i could never subscribe it

3423
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:19,280
would be ironic

3424
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:19,760
oh if uh if common ai is acquired by

3425
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,360
apple

3426
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,639
i mean facebook look i quit facebook 10

3427
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,679
years ago because i didn't respect the

3428
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,960
business model

3429
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:28,400
um google has declined so fast in the

3430
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:31,440
last five years

3431
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:34,480
what are your thoughts about waymo as

3432
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:37,280
present and future so let me let me see

3433
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:38,880
let me start by saying something uh nice

3434
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:41,730
which is uh

3435
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:43,119
i've visited them a few times and i've

3436
01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:46,560
[Music]

3437
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:49,679
have ridden in their cars and

3438
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:51,199
the engineering that they're doing

3439
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:52,639
both the research and the actual

3440
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,280
development and the engineering they're

3441
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:55,040
doing

3442
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,400
and the scale they're actually achieving

3443
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:59,280
by doing it all themselves

3444
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:01,440
is really impressive and the the balance

3445
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:04,560
of safety and innovation

3446
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:07,199
and like the cars work

3447
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,080
really well for the routes they drive

3448
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:10,560
like they drive

3449
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:12,159
fast which was very surprising to me

3450
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:14,080
like it drives like

3451
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:16,080
the speed limit or faster the speed

3452
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:17,920
limit it goes

3453
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:19,920
and it works really damn well and the

3454
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:21,520
interface is nice and chandler arizona

3455
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,719
yeah yeah yeah in challengers in a very

3456
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:25,440
specific environment so

3457
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:26,080
it i you know it gives me enough

3458
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,960
material

3459
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:30,560
in my mind to push back against the

3460
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:34,239
madman of the world like

3461
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:36,239
george hotz to be like

3462
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:38,080
like because you kind of imply there's

3463
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:41,520
zero probability they're going to win

3464
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:43,840
yeah and and after i've used

3465
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:46,639
after i've written in it to me it's not

3466
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:49,520
zero oh it's not for technology reasons

3467
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:51,920
bureaucracy no it's worse than that it's

3468
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:53,440
actually for product reasons i think

3469
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:55,679
oh you think they're just not capable of

3470
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:57,119
creating an amazing product uh

3471
01:55:55,679 --> 01:56:00,400
no i think that the product that they're

3472
01:55:57,119 --> 01:56:04,080
building doesn't make sense

3473
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:05,040
um so a few things uh you say the weimos

3474
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:07,920
are fast

3475
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:09,040
um benchmark away mo against a competent

3476
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,040
uber driver

3477
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:12,560
right right the uber driver is faster

3478
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,040
it's not even about speed it's the thing

3479
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:15,040
you said

3480
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:16,159
it's about the experience of being stuck

3481
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:18,000
at a stop sign

3482
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:20,080
because pedestrians are crossing

3483
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,520
non-stop

3484
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:23,440
i like when my uber driver doesn't come

3485
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:27,360
to a full stop at the stop sign yeah

3486
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:30,000
you know and so

3487
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:31,199
let's say the waymo's are 20 slower than

3488
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,760
than an uber

3489
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:34,880
right um you can argue they're going to

3490
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,960
be cheaper

3491
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,199
and i argue that users already have the

3492
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:42,639
choice to trade off money for speed

3493
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:43,440
it's called uberpool um i think it's

3494
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:46,480
like 15

3495
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:47,920
of rides or uber pools right users are

3496
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,480
not willing to trade off

3497
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:52,239
money for speed so the whole product

3498
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:55,040
that they're building

3499
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:56,719
is not going to be competitive with

3500
01:56:55,040 --> 01:57:02,080
traditional ride sharing networks

3501
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:02,080
right um like and also

3502
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:06,320
whether there's profit to be made

3503
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:07,280
depends entirely on one company having a

3504
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:10,639
monopoly

3505
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:12,080
i think that the level for autonomous

3506
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:13,520
ride sharing vehicles

3507
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:16,000
market is going to look a lot like the

3508
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:18,480
scooter market if even the technology

3509
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,320
does come to exist which i question

3510
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:21,760
who's doing well in that market yeah

3511
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:23,760
it's a race to the bottom

3512
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,599
you know well they could be it could be

3513
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,920
closer like an uber and a lyft

3514
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:28,719
where it's just a one or two players

3515
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:31,520
well

3516
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:32,960
the scooter people have given up trying

3517
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:35,360
to market scooters

3518
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:36,159
as a practical means of transportation

3519
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:38,320
and they're just like

3520
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:39,679
they're super fun to ride look at wheels

3521
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,560
i love those things and they're great on

3522
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:43,360
that front

3523
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,560
yeah but from an actual transportation

3524
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:46,320
product perspective

3525
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,920
i do not think scooters are viable and i

3526
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:49,119
do not think level 4 autonomous cars are

3527
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,679
viable

3528
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:52,239
if you uh let's play a fun experiment if

3529
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:56,880
you

3530
01:57:52,239 --> 01:58:00,000
ran let's do a tesla and let's do waymo

3531
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:02,560
if uh elon musk took a vacation for

3532
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,840
a year he just said screw it i'm gonna

3533
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:06,320
go live on an island

3534
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,920
no electronics and the board decides

3535
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:09,040
that we need to find somebody to run the

3536
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,960
company

3537
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,159
and they they decide that you should run

3538
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,880
the company for a year

3539
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:16,480
how do you run tesla differently i

3540
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,840
wouldn't change much

3541
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:20,480
do you think they're on the right track

3542
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:23,360
i wouldn't change i mean i'd have some

3543
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:24,080
minor changes but even even my debate

3544
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:27,440
with tesla

3545
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:29,840
about you know end to end versus segnets

3546
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,480
like that's just software who cares

3547
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:32,560
right

3548
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,320
like it's not gonna it's not like you're

3549
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,360
doing something terrible with segnats

3550
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,639
you're probably building something

3551
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:38,480
that's at least going to help you debug

3552
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:41,040
the end-to-end system a lot

3553
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,159
right it's very easy to transition from

3554
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:45,840
what they have

3555
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:49,199
to like an end-to-end kind of thing

3556
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:51,520
and then i presume you would uh

3557
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:52,960
in the model y or maybe in the model 3

3558
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,880
start adding driver sensing with

3559
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:57,520
infrared yes i would add i would

3560
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,080
i would add infrared camera infrared

3561
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,080
lights

3562
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:03,920
right away to those cars um

3563
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:05,520
and start collecting that data and do

3564
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,800
all that kind of stuff yeah

3565
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,480
very much i think they're already kind

3566
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,280
of doing it it's it's an incredibly

3567
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,960
minor change

3568
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:12,159
if i actually were ceo of tesla first

3569
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,000
off i'd be horrified that i wouldn't be

3570
01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:15,760
able to do a good job as elon

3571
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,280
and then i would try to you know

3572
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,639
understand the way he's done things

3573
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:20,000
before he would also have to take over

3574
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:22,719
his twitter

3575
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,840
so god i don't tweet yeah what's your

3576
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:26,400
twitter situation why

3577
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:27,280
why why are you so quiet on twitter

3578
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,520
comma is

3579
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:31,199
like what what's your social network

3580
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:33,520
presence like because you you

3581
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:35,119
on instagram you're you're you uh you do

3582
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:37,599
live streams you're

3583
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:39,119
you're you're um you understand the

3584
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:41,360
music of the internet

3585
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:43,280
but you don't always fully engage into

3586
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:44,159
it you're part-time i used to have a

3587
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:46,719
twitter

3588
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:47,599
yeah i mean it's the pr instagram is a

3589
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:49,119
pretty place

3590
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:50,800
instagram is a beautiful place it

3591
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:53,119
glorifies beauty i like i like

3592
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:55,920
instagram's values as a network

3593
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:57,040
um twitter glorifies conflict glorifies

3594
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,440
you know

3595
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:00,239
like like like like like you know just

3596
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,920
shots

3597
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:03,520
taking shots at people and it's like you

3598
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:05,280
know well

3599
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,199
you know twitter and donald trump are

3600
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:08,560
perfectly

3601
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:11,119
they're perfect for each other so

3602
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:12,719
tesla's on uh tesla's on the right track

3603
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:15,760
in your view yeah

3604
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:17,440
okay so let's try let's like really try

3605
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:19,840
this experiment if you ran

3606
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:20,880
way more let's say they're i don't know

3607
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,480
if you agree but

3608
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,800
they seem to be at the head of the pack

3609
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:26,960
of the kind of

3610
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:28,880
uh what would you call that approach

3611
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,239
like it's not necessarily lighter based

3612
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,599
because it's not about lighter but

3613
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:34,239
before robot taxi

3614
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:36,800
level four robot taxi all in before any

3615
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:38,159
before making your revenue

3616
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:41,280
uh so they're probably at the head of

3617
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:43,520
the pack if you were

3618
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,440
said hey george can you please run this

3619
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:48,000
company for a year how would you

3620
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:49,760
change it uh i would go i would get

3621
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,800
anthony levandowski out of jail

3622
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,800
and i would put him in charge of the

3623
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:58,159
company

3624
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,920
um let's try to break that apart

3625
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:01,360
why do you do you want to make do you

3626
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:01,920
want to destroy the company by doing

3627
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:05,360
that or

3628
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:09,440
do you mean or do you mean uh you like

3629
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:11,280
renegade style thinking that uh pushes

3630
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:12,560
that that like throws away bureaucracy

3631
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:12,960
and goes to first principle thinking

3632
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,239
what

3633
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,080
what do you mean by that um i think

3634
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:18,560
anthony lewandowski is a genius

3635
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:20,400
and i think he would come up with a much

3636
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:22,320
better idea of what to do with waymo

3637
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,239
than me

3638
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:26,560
so you mean that unironically he is a

3639
02:01:24,239 --> 02:01:29,360
genius oh yes oh absolutely

3640
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,960
without a doubt i mean i'm not saying

3641
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,800
there's no shortcomings

3642
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:34,719
but in the interactions i've had with

3643
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,440
him yeah

3644
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:39,280
what um he's also willing to take like

3645
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:41,040
who knows what he would do with waymo

3646
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:42,639
i mean he's also out there like far more

3647
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,119
out there than i am yeah there's big

3648
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:45,280
risks

3649
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:47,040
yeah what do you make of him i was i was

3650
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:48,880
going to talk to him in this podcast and

3651
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:51,840
i was going back and forth

3652
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:53,840
i'm i'm such a gullible naive human like

3653
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:56,480
i see the best in people

3654
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:59,679
and i slowly started to realize that

3655
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:03,920
there might be some people out there

3656
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:05,199
that like have multiple faces to the

3657
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:08,159
world

3658
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:09,520
they're like deceiving and dishonest i

3659
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:12,960
still

3660
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:14,719
refuse to like i i just i trust people

3661
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,599
and i don't care if i get hurt by it but

3662
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:17,040
like

3663
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:18,719
you know sometimes you have to be a

3664
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:19,520
little bit careful especially platform

3665
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:21,920
wise and

3666
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,040
podcast wise what do you what am i

3667
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,639
supposed to think

3668
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,320
so you think you think he's a good

3669
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:28,320
person

3670
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:29,760
oh i don't know i don't really make

3671
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:31,920
moral judgments

3672
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,199
and it's difficult to oh oh i mean this

3673
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:35,040
about the waymo actually i mean that

3674
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:36,080
whole idea very non-ironically about

3675
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,360
what i would do

3676
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:39,440
the problem with putting me in charge of

3677
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:41,599
waymo is waymo is already

3678
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:43,679
10 billion dollars in the hull right

3679
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:45,599
whatever idea waymo does look

3680
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,199
com is profitable comes raised 8.1

3681
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:48,560
million dollars that's small

3682
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:50,159
you know that's small money like i can

3683
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,800
build a reasonable consumer electronics

3684
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,119
company

3685
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,719
and succeed wildly at that and still

3686
02:02:53,119 --> 02:02:55,679
never be able to pay back weight most 10

3687
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:58,400
billion

3688
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,920
so i i think the basic idea with women

3689
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:01,679
well forget the 10 billion because they

3690
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,920
have some backing but

3691
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,599
your basic thing is like what can we do

3692
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:07,840
to stop making some money

3693
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:09,280
well no i mean my bigger idea is like

3694
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,239
whatever the idea is that's going to

3695
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:12,159
save waymo

3696
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:14,320
i don't have it it's going to have to be

3697
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:16,080
a big risk idea and i cannot think of a

3698
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,679
better person than anthony lewandowski

3699
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,280
to do it

3700
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:21,040
so that is completely what i would do as

3701
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:22,480
ceo of waymo i call myself a

3702
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:24,159
transitionary ceo

3703
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:26,960
do everything i can to fix that

3704
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:29,440
situation yeah

3705
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:30,960
uh yeah cause i can't i can't do it

3706
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,599
right like i can't i can't

3707
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:35,280
oh i mean i can talk about how what i

3708
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:36,320
really want to do is just apologize for

3709
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,239
all those corny

3710
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:40,000
uh you know ad campaigns and be like

3711
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:42,159
here's the real state of the technology

3712
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,679
yeah um like i have several criticism

3713
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:46,719
i'm a little bit more bullish on

3714
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:49,119
waymo than than you seem to be but

3715
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:50,719
one criticism i have is it went into

3716
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:52,560
corny mode too early

3717
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,920
like it's still a startup it hasn't

3718
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,960
delivered on anything so

3719
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:59,199
it should be like more renegade and show

3720
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,800
off the engineering that they're doing

3721
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:03,599
which just can be impressive as opposed

3722
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:06,239
to doing these weird commercials of like

3723
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:06,800
your friendly yeah your friendly car

3724
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:08,320
company

3725
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:10,400
i mean that's my biggest my biggest

3726
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:11,199
snipe at waymo was always that guy's a

3727
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,280
paid actor

3728
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:15,280
that guy's not a waymo user he's a paid

3729
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:17,280
actor look here i found his call sheet

3730
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:19,440
do kind of like what spacex is doing

3731
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:21,199
with uh the rocket launchers just

3732
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:23,599
get put the nerds up front put the

3733
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:26,320
engineers up front and just like

3734
02:04:23,599 --> 02:04:27,440
show failures too just i love i love

3735
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:29,440
spacex's

3736
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:30,560
yeah yeah the thing they're doing is

3737
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:32,719
right and it just

3738
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:34,320
feels like the right but we're all so

3739
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:36,000
excited to see them succeed

3740
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:38,320
yeah i can't wait to see when it won't

3741
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,280
fail you know like you lie to me i want

3742
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:40,800
you to fail

3743
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:44,000
you tell me the truth you'll be honest

3744
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:46,960
with me i want you to succeed yeah

3745
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,400
uh yeah and that requires the uh the

3746
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:51,679
renegade ceo

3747
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:53,599
right i'm with you i'm with you i still

3748
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:56,000
have a little bit of faith in waymo to

3749
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:57,760
for for the renegade ceo to step forward

3750
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:01,280
but

3751
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:03,280
it's not it's not john krafter yeah

3752
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:04,800
it's uh you can't it's not chris

3753
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:06,719
holmstone

3754
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,159
and those people may be very good at

3755
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:10,880
certain things yeah

3756
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:12,239
but they're not renegades because these

3757
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,239
companies are fundamentally even though

3758
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:16,159
we're talking about billion dollars

3759
02:05:14,239 --> 02:05:19,119
all these crazy numbers they're still

3760
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:21,679
like early stage startups

3761
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:23,280
i mean i i just i if you are pre-revenue

3762
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:24,560
and you've raised 10 billion dollars i

3763
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:26,719
have no idea like

3764
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:27,920
like this just doesn't work no it's

3765
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:29,679
against everything silicon valley

3766
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,679
where's your minimum viable product

3767
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:33,199
you know where's your users what's your

3768
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:36,320
growth numbers

3769
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:37,840
this is traditional silicon valley why

3770
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:39,360
do you not apply it to what you think

3771
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:43,840
you're too big to fail already

3772
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:46,079
like how do you think autonomous

3773
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:46,960
driving will change society so the

3774
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:50,000
mission is

3775
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:53,440
for comma to uh solve

3776
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,719
self-driving do you have like a vision

3777
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:57,440
of the world of how

3778
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,440
it'll be different

3779
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:01,040
is it as simple as a to b transportation

3780
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,320
or is there like

3781
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:05,840
because these are robots it's not about

3782
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:08,960
autonomous driving in and of itself it's

3783
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,960
what the technology enables

3784
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:14,079
it's i think it's the coolest applied ai

3785
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:17,599
problem i like it because it has a clear

3786
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:19,760
path to monetary value um

3787
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:21,280
but as far as that being the thing that

3788
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:24,719
changes the world

3789
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:25,840
i mean no like like there's cute things

3790
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:26,560
we're doing in common like who thought

3791
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:28,880
you could stick a

3792
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,560
phone on the windshield middle drive um

3793
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:31,760
but like really the product that you're

3794
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:33,760
building is not

3795
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:35,520
something that people were not capable

3796
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:36,719
of imagining 50 years ago

3797
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,480
so no it doesn't change the world in

3798
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:40,480
that front could people imagine the

3799
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:42,639
internet 50 years ago only true

3800
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:44,239
junior genius visionaries yeah everyone

3801
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:44,880
could have imagined autonomous cars 50

3802
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:46,880
years ago

3803
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,560
it's like a core but i don't drive it

3804
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:51,360
see i i have this sense

3805
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:52,239
and i told you like i'm my long-term

3806
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:55,760
dream

3807
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:57,360
is robots with which you have deep

3808
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:59,280
with whom you have deep connections

3809
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,679
right

3810
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:03,520
and there's different trajectories

3811
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:05,280
towards that

3812
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:08,239
and i've been thinking so i've been

3813
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:10,320
thinking of launching a startup

3814
02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:13,119
i see autonomous vehicles as a potential

3815
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:15,679
trajectory to that that

3816
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:16,800
i'm that's not where the direction i

3817
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:19,280
would like to go but

3818
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:21,679
i also see tesla or even kamehameha like

3819
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:24,800
pivoting into

3820
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:26,480
into robotics broadly defined

3821
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,840
that's at some stage in the way like

3822
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,520
you're mentioning the internet didn't

3823
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,920
expect

3824
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:33,360
let's solve you know when i say a comma

3825
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,599
about this we could talk about this but

3826
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:37,280
let's solve self-driving cars first

3827
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:39,119
got to stay focused on the mission don't

3828
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,280
don't don't you're not too big to fail

3829
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:42,400
for however much i think kama's winning

3830
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:44,000
like no no

3831
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,440
no you're winning when you solve level

3832
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,400
five self-driving cars and until then

3833
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:48,400
you haven't win and

3834
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:50,000
one and you know again you want to be

3835
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:51,199
arrogant in the face of other people

3836
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,599
great you want to be arrogant in the

3837
02:07:51,199 --> 02:07:56,239
face of nature you're an idiot right

3838
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:57,040
stay mission focused brilliantly put uh

3839
02:07:56,239 --> 02:07:58,639
like i mentioned

3840
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:00,560
thinking of launching a startup i've

3841
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:02,239
been considering actually before

3842
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,840
cove i've been thinking of moving to san

3843
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:07,119
francisco oh

3844
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:09,119
oh i wouldn't go there so why is uh

3845
02:08:07,119 --> 02:08:10,800
okay well and now i'm thinking about

3846
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:14,159
potentially austin

3847
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:14,880
um and we're in san diego now san diego

3848
02:08:14,159 --> 02:08:18,320
come here

3849
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:20,400
so why what um

3850
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:21,840
i mean you're such an interesting human

3851
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:23,040
you've launched so many successful

3852
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:26,480
things

3853
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:29,119
what uh why san diego what do you

3854
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:31,920
recommend why not san francisco

3855
02:08:29,119 --> 02:08:33,760
have you thought so for in your case san

3856
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,639
diego with qualcomm and snapdragon i

3857
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,280
mean

3858
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:38,400
that's an amazing combination but that

3859
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:40,480
wasn't really why

3860
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:42,000
that wasn't the why no i mean qualcomm

3861
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,960
was an afterthought qualcomm was it was

3862
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,840
a nice thing to think about it's like

3863
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,679
you can have

3864
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:48,159
a tech company here and a good one i

3865
02:08:45,679 --> 02:08:50,000
mean you know i like qualcomm but

3866
02:08:48,159 --> 02:08:51,360
no um what's the west san diego better

3867
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,760
than stephanie why does san francisco

3868
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:53,520
suck

3869
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,199
well so okay so first off we all kind of

3870
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:57,920
said like we want to stay in california

3871
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:58,719
people like the ocean you know

3872
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:01,280
california

3873
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:03,040
for for its flaws it's like a lot of the

3874
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:04,159
flaws of california are not necessarily

3875
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,679
california as a whole and they're much

3876
02:09:04,159 --> 02:09:08,560
more san francisco specific

3877
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:09,760
yeah um san francisco so i think first

3878
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:13,199
year cities in general

3879
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:15,119
have stopped wanting growth uh

3880
02:09:13,199 --> 02:09:17,599
well you have like in san francisco you

3881
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:19,199
know the voting class always votes to

3882
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:20,960
not build more houses because they own

3883
02:09:19,199 --> 02:09:22,960
all the houses and they're like well

3884
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:24,159
you know once people have figured out

3885
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:25,119
how to vote themselves more money

3886
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:28,320
they're going to do it

3887
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:29,679
it is so insanely corrupt um it is not

3888
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:32,079
balanced at all

3889
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:34,560
like political party-wise you know it's

3890
02:09:32,079 --> 02:09:38,079
it's a one-party city and

3891
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:41,760
for all the discussion of diversity it's

3892
02:09:38,079 --> 02:09:43,840
has it's stops lacking real diversity of

3893
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:48,400
thought of background of uh

3894
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:51,280
approaches to strategies of yeah ideas

3895
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:52,480
it's it's kind of a strange place that

3896
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:54,960
it's the loudest

3897
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:56,239
people about diversity and the biggest

3898
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:58,239
lack of diversity

3899
02:09:56,239 --> 02:10:00,239
well i mean that's that's what they say

3900
02:09:58,239 --> 02:10:02,800
right it's the projection

3901
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:04,320
projection yeah yeah it's interesting

3902
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:06,079
and even people in silicon valley tell

3903
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:08,639
me that's uh

3904
02:10:06,079 --> 02:10:10,239
like high up people but everybody is

3905
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:12,159
like this is a terrible place it doesn't

3906
02:10:10,239 --> 02:10:13,119
make i mean and coronavirus is really

3907
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:16,000
what killed it yeah

3908
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:17,119
san francisco was the number one uh

3909
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,840
exodus

3910
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:21,599
during coronavirus we still think san

3911
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,639
diego is a good place to be

3912
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:28,079
yeah yeah i mean we'll see

3913
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:30,320
we'll see what happens with california

3914
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:32,079
a bit longer term yeah i like austrians

3915
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,119
and austin's an interesting choice i

3916
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:35,280
wouldn't i wouldn't i don't have really

3917
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:36,800
anything bad to say about austin

3918
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,800
either except for the extreme heat in

3919
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:40,400
the summer um which you know but that's

3920
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:42,159
like very on the surface right i think

3921
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:44,320
as far as like an ecosystem

3922
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:45,360
goes it's it's cool i personally love

3923
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:47,760
colorado

3924
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:48,560
colorado uh yeah i mean you have these

3925
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,920
states that are

3926
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:54,000
you know like just way better run

3927
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:55,840
um california is you know it's

3928
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,920
especially san francisco so it's high

3929
02:10:55,840 --> 02:11:01,280
horse and like

3930
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:04,480
yeah can i ask you for advice

3931
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:06,239
to me and to others about

3932
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:08,239
what's it take to build a successful

3933
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:09,040
startup oh i don't know i haven't done

3934
02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:11,760
that

3935
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:13,840
talk to someone who did that well you

3936
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,840
know

3937
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:18,000
uh this is like another book of years

3938
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:22,400
that i'll buy for 67

3939
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:22,400
i suppose uh so there's um

3940
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:25,520
one of these days will sell out yeah

3941
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:27,840
that's right jail breaks are going to be

3942
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:31,280
a dollar and books are going to be 67.

3943
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:32,719
how i uh how i joe broke the iphone by

3944
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:35,199
george cotts that's right

3945
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:37,599
how i jailbroke the iphone and you can

3946
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:37,599
do it

3947
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:42,800
that's right that's right oh god okay i

3948
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:45,040
can't wait but

3949
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:46,639
quite so you haven't introspected you

3950
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:49,760
have built

3951
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:53,119
a very unique company i mean

3952
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:56,320
not not you but you and others

3953
02:11:53,119 --> 02:11:57,679
but i don't know um there's no

3954
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:59,920
there's nothing you have an interest but

3955
02:11:57,679 --> 02:12:01,599
you haven't really sat down and thought

3956
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:03,040
about like

3957
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:06,079
well like if you and i we're having a

3958
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:08,159
bunch of we're having some beers

3959
02:12:06,079 --> 02:12:09,760
and you're seeing that i'm depressed and

3960
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:13,040
whatever i'm struggling

3961
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:16,960
there's no advice you can give oh i mean

3962
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:16,960
more beer more beer

3963
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:22,719
yeah i think it's all very like

3964
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:25,040
situation dependent

3965
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:25,840
um here's okay if i can give a generic

3966
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:28,239
piece of advice

3967
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:29,360
it's the technology always wins the

3968
02:12:28,239 --> 02:12:32,840
better technology

3969
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:36,320
always wins and lying always

3970
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:39,840
loses build technology

3971
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:40,320
and don't lie i'm with you i agree very

3972
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:42,079
much

3973
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,920
the long run long run sure it's the long

3974
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:45,520
run you know what the market can remain

3975
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:46,480
irrational longer than you can remain

3976
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:48,320
solvent

3977
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:50,079
true fact well this is this is an

3978
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:52,079
interesting point because i

3979
02:12:50,079 --> 02:12:54,320
ethically and just as a human believe

3980
02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:57,520
that um

3981
02:12:54,320 --> 02:13:01,040
like sm like hype and smoke and mirrors

3982
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:02,639
is not at any stage of the company is a

3983
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:05,280
good strategy

3984
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:06,639
i mean there's some like you know pr

3985
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:08,560
magic kind of like

3986
02:13:06,639 --> 02:13:09,679
you know you want a new product yeah if

3987
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:11,360
there's a call to action

3988
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:13,440
if there's like a call to action like

3989
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:15,280
buy my new gpu look at it it takes up

3990
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:16,480
three slots and it's this big it's huge

3991
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:18,239
buy my g for you yeah

3992
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:20,239
that's great if you look at you know

3993
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:22,639
especially in that in the ai space

3994
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:24,239
broadly but autonomous vehicles

3995
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:26,480
like you can raise a huge amount of

3996
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:28,159
money on nothing

3997
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:30,960
and the question to me is like i'm

3998
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:34,560
against that i'll never be

3999
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:37,920
part of that i don't think i hope not

4000
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:40,000
willingly not but like is there

4001
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:44,079
something to be said

4002
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:46,320
to uh essentially lying to raise

4003
02:13:44,079 --> 02:13:47,760
money like fake it till you make it kind

4004
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:49,679
of thing

4005
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,119
i mean this is billy mcfarland the fire

4006
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:53,840
festival like we all we all

4007
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:55,040
experienced uh you know what happens

4008
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:57,599
with that no

4009
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:58,320
no don't fake it till you make it be

4010
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:00,639
honest

4011
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:01,840
and hope you make it the whole way the

4012
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:04,159
technology wins

4013
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,360
right the technology wins and like there

4014
02:14:04,159 --> 02:14:07,199
is i'm not

4015
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:09,520
i use like the anti-hype you know that's

4016
02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:13,119
that's a slava kpss reference but

4017
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:16,159
um hype isn't necessarily bad

4018
02:14:13,119 --> 02:14:19,199
i loved camping out for the iphones

4019
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:20,000
um you know and as long as the hype is

4020
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:21,760
backed by

4021
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,040
like substance as long as it's backed by

4022
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:26,400
something i can actually

4023
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:27,360
buy and like it's real then hype is

4024
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:30,159
great and it's a great

4025
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:31,920
feeling it's when the hype is backed by

4026
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:33,520
lies that it's a bad feeling

4027
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:35,520
i mean a lot of people call elon musk a

4028
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:36,880
fraud how could he be a fraud

4029
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:38,960
i've noticed this this kind of

4030
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:42,320
interesting effect which is

4031
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:44,719
he does tend to over promise

4032
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:45,679
and deliver what's what's the better way

4033
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:48,560
to phrase it

4034
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:50,239
promise a timeline that he doesn't

4035
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:52,639
deliver on he delivers much

4036
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:54,079
later on what do you think about that

4037
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:55,119
because i do that i think that's a

4038
02:14:54,079 --> 02:14:58,079
programmer thing

4039
02:14:55,119 --> 02:15:00,239
yeah i do that as well you think that's

4040
02:14:58,079 --> 02:15:02,560
a really bad thing to do or

4041
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:03,840
is that okay i think that's again as

4042
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:05,679
long as like

4043
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:06,880
you're working toward it and you're

4044
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:10,159
gonna deliver on it

4045
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:13,119
it's not too far off right

4046
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:13,520
right like like you know the whole the

4047
02:15:13,119 --> 02:15:16,079
whole

4048
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:17,440
autonomous vehicle thing it's like i

4049
02:15:16,079 --> 02:15:19,920
mean i still think

4050
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:21,280
tesla's on track to beat us i still

4051
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,000
think even with their even with their

4052
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:25,520
missteps they

4053
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:28,560
have advantages we don't have um

4054
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:31,360
you know illness is better than me at

4055
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:33,119
at like marshaling massive amounts of

4056
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:36,159
resources

4057
02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:37,280
so you know i still think given the fact

4058
02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:38,159
they're maybe making some wrong

4059
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:41,280
decisions

4060
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:43,440
they'll end up winning and like

4061
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:44,320
it's fine to hype it if you're actually

4062
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:46,400
gonna win

4063
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:48,239
right if elon says look we're gonna be

4064
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:49,360
landing rockets back on earth in a year

4065
02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:52,639
and it takes four

4066
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:53,520
like you know he landed a rocket back on

4067
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:55,040
earth

4068
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:56,960
and he was working toward it the whole

4069
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:58,960
time i think there's some amount of like

4070
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:00,400
i think when it becomes wrong is if you

4071
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:02,960
know you're not gonna meet that deadline

4072
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:03,679
if you're lying yeah that's brilliantly

4073
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:06,400
put like

4074
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:06,800
this is what people don't understand i

4075
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:09,520
think

4076
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:10,239
like elon believes everything he says he

4077
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,560
does

4078
02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:13,840
as far as i can tell he does and i i

4079
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:16,960
detected that

4080
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:18,000
in myself too like if i it's only

4081
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:21,280
 if

4082
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,840
you're like conscious of yourself lying

4083
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:25,360
yeah i think so yeah you know you can't

4084
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:26,960
take that to such an extreme

4085
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:28,719
right like in a way i think maybe billy

4086
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:29,920
mcfarland believed everything he said

4087
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:31,840
too

4088
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:33,760
right that's how you started cult and

4089
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:36,160
everybody uh kills themselves

4090
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:37,519
yeah yeah like it's you need you need if

4091
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:39,920
there's like some

4092
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:41,280
factor on it it's fine and you need some

4093
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:44,479
people to like

4094
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:46,240
you know keep you in check but like

4095
02:16:44,479 --> 02:16:48,240
if you deliver on most of the things you

4096
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:50,319
say and just the timelines are off

4097
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:51,920
yeah it does piss people off though i

4098
02:16:50,319 --> 02:16:54,559
wonder

4099
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:55,200
but who cares in the long arc of history

4100
02:16:54,559 --> 02:16:57,120
the people

4101
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,559
everybody gets pissed off at the people

4102
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:00,240
who succeed which is

4103
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:01,840
one of the things that frustrates me

4104
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:05,200
about this world

4105
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:09,120
is uh they don't celebrate

4106
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:11,439
the success of others like

4107
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:12,800
there's so many people that want elon to

4108
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:15,920
fail

4109
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:19,200
it's so fascinating to me like what

4110
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:21,519
is wrong with you like so

4111
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:23,200
elon musk talks about like people short

4112
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:24,559
like they talk about financial

4113
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:26,240
yeah but i think it's much bigger than

4114
02:17:24,559 --> 02:17:28,319
the financials i've seen like the human

4115
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:31,519
factors community they

4116
02:17:28,319 --> 02:17:34,559
want they want other people to fail

4117
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:36,639
why why why like even people the

4118
02:17:34,559 --> 02:17:38,240
harshest thing is like

4119
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:39,840
you know even people that like seem to

4120
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:42,319
really hate donald trump

4121
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:43,120
they want him to fail yeah or like the

4122
02:17:42,319 --> 02:17:47,200
other president or

4123
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:50,800
they want barack obama to fail it's like

4124
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:52,880
we're almost involved it's weird but i

4125
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:54,080
i want that i would love to inspire that

4126
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:57,040
part of the world to change

4127
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:58,880
because well damn it if the human

4128
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,319
species is going to survive we should

4129
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:02,000
celebrate success

4130
02:18:00,319 --> 02:18:04,240
like it seems like the efficient thing

4131
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,240
to do in this objective function that

4132
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:08,559
like we're all striving for

4133
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:10,000
is to celebrate the ones that like

4134
02:18:08,559 --> 02:18:12,240
figure out how to like do better

4135
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,920
at that objective function as opposed to

4136
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:17,040
like dragging them down

4137
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:17,679
back into them into the mud i think

4138
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:19,280
there is

4139
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:21,280
this is the speech i always give about

4140
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,200
the commenters on hacker news

4141
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:24,719
um so first off something to remember

4142
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:27,760
about the internet in general

4143
02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:28,800
is commenters are not representative of

4144
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:31,439
the population

4145
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:32,240
yeah i don't comment on anything i don't

4146
02:18:31,439 --> 02:18:34,559
you know

4147
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:36,639
commenters are are representative of a

4148
02:18:34,559 --> 02:18:39,120
certain sliver of the population

4149
02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:40,719
and on hacker news a common thing i'll

4150
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:42,000
say is when you'll see something that's

4151
02:18:40,719 --> 02:18:45,120
like

4152
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,519
you know promises to be wild out there

4153
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:48,880
and

4154
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:50,960
in innovative there is some amount of

4155
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:52,240
you know checking them back to earth but

4156
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:56,000
there's also some amount of

4157
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:58,880
if this thing succeeds well

4158
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:02,000
i'm 36 and i've worked at large tech

4159
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:02,000
companies my whole life

4160
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:06,240
they can't succeed because if they

4161
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:07,439
succeed that would mean that i could

4162
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:07,920
have done something different with my

4163
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:09,439
life

4164
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:10,880
but we know that i couldn't have we know

4165
02:19:09,439 --> 02:19:11,840
that i couldn't have and and that's why

4166
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:13,120
they're going to fail

4167
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,920
and they have to root for them to fail

4168
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:19,120
to kind of maintain their world image

4169
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:22,000
so tune it out and they comment well

4170
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:24,240
it's hard i uh so one of the things one

4171
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:27,519
of the things i'm considering

4172
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:30,559
startup wise is to change that

4173
02:19:27,519 --> 02:19:32,719
because i think the i think it's also

4174
02:19:30,559 --> 02:19:34,880
a technology problem it's a platform

4175
02:19:32,719 --> 02:19:36,399
problem i agree it's like

4176
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:39,120
because the thing you said most people

4177
02:19:36,399 --> 02:19:39,120
don't comment

4178
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:44,559
i think most people want to comment

4179
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:46,479
they just don't because it's all the

4180
02:19:44,559 --> 02:19:47,920
 for commenting exactly i don't

4181
02:19:46,479 --> 02:19:49,280
want to be grouped in with that or not

4182
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:50,640
you don't want to be in a at a party

4183
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:53,439
where everyone is an

4184
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:54,399
yeah so they but that's a platform

4185
02:19:53,439 --> 02:19:56,080
problem that's

4186
02:19:54,399 --> 02:19:58,479
i can't believe what reddit's become i

4187
02:19:56,080 --> 02:20:00,479
can't believe the group think in reddit

4188
02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:02,640
comments

4189
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:05,040
there's a red is an interesting one

4190
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:07,520
because they're subreddits

4191
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:09,120
and so you can still see especially

4192
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:12,080
small subreddits

4193
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:12,800
that like that are little like havens of

4194
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:16,080
like

4195
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:17,920
joy and positivity and like deep

4196
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:20,080
even disagreement but like nuanced

4197
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:21,600
discussion but it's only like small

4198
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:23,439
little pockets

4199
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:25,439
but that's uh that's emergent the

4200
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:29,040
platform's not helping that or

4201
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:31,439
hurting that so i guess naturally

4202
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:32,960
something about the internet uh if you

4203
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:34,399
don't put in a lot of effort to

4204
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:37,680
encourage

4205
02:20:34,399 --> 02:20:41,120
nuance and positive good vibes it's

4206
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:42,800
naturally going to decline into chaos

4207
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:44,319
i would love to see someone do this well

4208
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:46,319
yeah um i think it's

4209
02:20:44,319 --> 02:20:47,439
yeah very doable this is uh i think

4210
02:20:46,319 --> 02:20:50,640
actually so

4211
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:53,680
i i feel like twitter could be

4212
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:57,920
overthrown joshua bach talked about how

4213
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:58,720
like uh if you have like and retweet

4214
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:02,000
like

4215
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:04,240
that's only positive wiring right

4216
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,520
the only way to do anything like

4217
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:08,800
negative there

4218
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:12,240
is um with a comment and

4219
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:14,160
that's like that asymmetry is what gives

4220
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:15,439
you know twitter its particular

4221
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:16,880
toxicness

4222
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:18,720
whereas i find youtube comments to be

4223
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:19,600
much better because youtube comments

4224
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:22,000
have a have a

4225
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:23,680
of an up and a down and they don't show

4226
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,359
the downloads

4227
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:26,720
without getting into depth of this

4228
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:29,439
particular discussion

4229
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:32,160
the point is to explore possibilities

4230
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:33,520
and get a lot of data on it because uh

4231
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:35,359
i mean i could disagree with what you

4232
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:35,920
just said it's it's uh the point is it's

4233
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:37,840
unclear

4234
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:39,760
it's a it hasn't been explored in a

4235
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:42,319
really rich way

4236
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:44,000
like the these questions of how to

4237
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:47,280
create

4238
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,439
platforms that encourage positivity yeah

4239
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:51,120
i think it's a it's a technology problem

4240
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:52,880
and i think we'll look back at twitter

4241
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,680
as it is now maybe it'll happen within

4242
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:56,399
twitter

4243
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:57,680
but most likely somebody overthrows them

4244
02:21:56,399 --> 02:22:00,399
is

4245
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:02,319
we'll look back at twitter and say we

4246
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:03,680
can't believe we put up with this level

4247
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:04,960
of toxicity you need a different

4248
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:06,399
business model too

4249
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:07,760
any any social network that

4250
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:08,640
fundamentally has advertising as a

4251
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:10,640
business model

4252
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:11,760
this was in the social dilemma which i

4253
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:12,880
didn't watch but i liked it it's like

4254
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:15,760
you know there's always the you know

4255
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:17,359
you're the product you're not the uh but

4256
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:18,960
they had a nuanced take on it that i

4257
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:22,800
really liked and it said

4258
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:24,479
the product being sold is influence over

4259
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:26,960
you

4260
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:27,520
the product being sold is literally your

4261
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:30,640
you know

4262
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:33,600
influence on you like

4263
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:34,319
that can't be if that's your idea okay

4264
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:36,960
well

4265
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:37,520
you know guess what it cannot be toxic

4266
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:40,000
yeah

4267
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:40,880
maybe there's ways to spin it like with

4268
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,560
with uh giving

4269
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:44,319
a lot more control to the user and

4270
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:45,439
transparency to see what is happening to

4271
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:47,520
them as opposed to

4272
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:49,280
in the shadows as possible but that

4273
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:50,399
can't be the primary source of

4274
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:52,479
but the users aren't no one's going to

4275
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:54,560
use that it depends

4276
02:22:52,479 --> 02:22:55,760
it depends it depends i think i think

4277
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:58,399
that the you're

4278
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:00,080
you're not going to you can't depend on

4279
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:01,680
self-awareness of the users

4280
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:03,120
it's a it's another it's a longer

4281
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:06,160
discussion because uh

4282
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:09,760
you can't depend on it but

4283
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:11,520
you can reward self-awareness

4284
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:13,520
like if for the ones who are willing to

4285
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:16,080
put in the work of self-awareness

4286
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:18,160
you can reward them and incentivize and

4287
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:20,080
perhaps be pleasantly surprised how many

4288
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:22,240
people

4289
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:23,120
are are willing to be self-aware on the

4290
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:24,800
internet

4291
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:26,240
like we are in real life like i'm

4292
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,800
putting a lot of effort with you right

4293
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:28,560
now

4294
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:29,840
being self-aware about if i say

4295
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:31,840
something stupid or mean

4296
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:33,680
sure i'll like look at your like body

4297
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:35,200
language like i'm putting in that effort

4298
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:36,240
it's costly for an introvert it's very

4299
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:39,439
costly

4300
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:41,520
but on the internet it

4301
02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:43,840
like most people are like i don't care

4302
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:45,120
if if this hurts somebody i don't care

4303
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:47,120
if this uh

4304
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:48,560
is not interesting or if this is yeah

4305
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:50,399
the mean or whatever

4306
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:52,479
i think so much of the engagement today

4307
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:54,080
on the internet is so disingenuous too

4308
02:23:52,479 --> 02:23:55,600
yeah you're not doing this out of a

4309
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:56,640
genuine this is what you think you're

4310
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:58,319
doing this just straight up to

4311
02:23:56,640 --> 02:24:00,880
manipulate others whether you're in you

4312
02:23:58,319 --> 02:24:02,880
just became an ad okay

4313
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:04,240
okay let's talk about a fun topic which

4314
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:06,000
is programming

4315
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:08,479
here's another book idea for you let me

4316
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,600
pitch uh what's your uh perfect

4317
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:12,960
programming setup

4318
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:17,040
so like this by george hotz so

4319
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:18,880
uh like what listen you're

4320
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:20,560
giving me give me a macbook air sitting

4321
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:21,920
in a corner of a hotel room and you know

4322
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:22,560
i'll still have so you really don't care

4323
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:25,280
you don't

4324
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:26,240
fetishize like multiple monitors

4325
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:28,640
keyboard

4326
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:30,160
uh those things are nice and i'm not

4327
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,560
going to say no to them

4328
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:34,160
but do they automatically unlock tons of

4329
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:35,600
productivity no not at all i have

4330
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:38,160
definitely been more productive on a

4331
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:41,520
macbook air in a corner of a hotel room

4332
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:44,560
what about ide

4333
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:47,920
so uh which operating system

4334
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:48,319
do you love what uh text editor do you

4335
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:50,960
use

4336
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:52,000
ide what um is there is there something

4337
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:53,520
that

4338
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
is like the perfect if you could just

4339
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,160
say the perfect productivity

4340
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,120
set up for george hawks doesn't matter

4341
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:00,800
it doesn't doesn't matter

4342
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:02,960
it really doesn't matter you know i

4343
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:04,399
guess i code most of the time in vim

4344
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:06,080
like literally i'm using an editor from

4345
02:25:04,399 --> 02:25:08,080
the 70s you know you didn't

4346
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:09,200
make anything better okay vs code is

4347
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:10,080
nice for reading code there's a few

4348
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:12,319
things that are nice about

4349
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:13,439
it uh i think that they're you can build

4350
02:25:12,319 --> 02:25:15,520
much better tools

4351
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:18,479
how like ida's xrefs work way better

4352
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:20,080
than vx vs codes why

4353
02:25:18,479 --> 02:25:21,920
yeah actually that's a good question

4354
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:25,200
like why i i still use

4355
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:26,880
sorry emacs eat for most uh

4356
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:28,640
i've actually know i have to confess

4357
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:31,920
something dark

4358
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:36,319
cause i've never used bim yeah

4359
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:39,050
it's i think maybe i'm just afraid

4360
02:25:36,319 --> 02:25:40,560
that my life has been a like a waste

4361
02:25:39,050 --> 02:25:42,960
[Laughter]

4362
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:43,600
i'm so i'm not i'm not evangelical about

4363
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:45,600
emacs i

4364
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,120
i think this this is how i feel about

4365
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:49,120
tender flow versus pie torch

4366
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:50,720
yeah having just like we've switched

4367
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:51,760
everything to pie torch now put months

4368
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:53,520
into the switch

4369
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:56,160
i have felt like i've wasted years on

4370
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:57,680
tensorflow i can't believe it

4371
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:59,359
i can't believe how much better pie

4372
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:01,359
torch is yeah

4373
02:25:59,359 --> 02:26:02,960
i've used emacs and them doesn't matter

4374
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:04,800
yeah still just my heart

4375
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:06,240
somehow i fell in love with lisp i don't

4376
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:08,080
know why you can't

4377
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:09,760
the heart wants what the heart wants i

4378
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,880
don't i don't understand it but it just

4379
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:12,640
connected with me maybe it's the

4380
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:13,120
functional language at first i connected

4381
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,960
with

4382
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:16,720
maybe it's because so many of the ai

4383
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:17,760
courses before the deep learning

4384
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:20,000
revolution were taught

4385
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:21,680
with lisp in mind i don't know i don't

4386
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,359
know what it is but i'm i'm

4387
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:25,359
stuck with it but at the same time like

4388
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:27,120
why am i not using a modern id for some

4389
02:26:25,359 --> 02:26:28,640
of these programming like i don't know

4390
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:30,560
they're not that much better i've used

4391
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:31,040
modernity to use them but at the same

4392
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:33,439
time so

4393
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:35,680
to just not to disagree with you but

4394
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:38,319
like i like multiple monitors

4395
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:39,520
like i've i have to do work on a laptop

4396
02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:41,760
and

4397
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:43,120
it's a it's a pain in the ass and also

4398
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:45,840
i'm addicted to the

4399
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:47,680
kinesis weird keyboard that you could

4400
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:50,000
you could see

4401
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:51,680
uh yeah so you don't have any of that

4402
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,560
you can just be in a macbook

4403
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:56,399
i mean look at work i have three 24-inch

4404
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:57,280
monitors i have a happy hacking keyboard

4405
02:26:56,399 --> 02:27:00,240
i have a

4406
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:01,920
razer death header mouse like but it's

4407
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:04,080
not essential for you no

4408
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:05,520
let's go to a day in the life of george

4409
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:08,880
hotz what is the

4410
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:10,319
perfect day productivity-wise so we're

4411
02:27:08,880 --> 02:27:13,359
not talking about like

4412
02:27:10,319 --> 02:27:16,560
hunter s thompson uh drugs yeah and uh

4413
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:16,880
let's let's look at productivity like

4414
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:19,280
what

4415
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:21,200
what's the day look like on like hour by

4416
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:24,080
hour is there any

4417
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:25,760
irregularities that create a magical

4418
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:28,319
george hawks experience

4419
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:30,240
i can remember three days in my life and

4420
02:27:28,319 --> 02:27:34,640
i remember these days vividly

4421
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:37,040
when i've gone through kind of

4422
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:37,760
radical transformations to the way i

4423
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,120
think

4424
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:40,399
and what i would give i would pay a

4425
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:42,319
hundred thousand dollars if i could have

4426
02:27:40,399 --> 02:27:44,960
one of these days tomorrow

4427
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:46,800
um the days have been so impactful and

4428
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:49,200
one was first discovering eliezer

4429
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:51,760
yukowski on the singularity

4430
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:53,120
and reading that stuff and like you know

4431
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:56,319
my mind was blown

4432
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:58,640
um the next was discovering

4433
02:27:56,319 --> 02:27:59,760
uh the hutter price and then ai is just

4434
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:02,479
compression

4435
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:03,600
like finally understanding aix i and

4436
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:04,800
what all that was

4437
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:06,560
you know i like read about it when i was

4438
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:08,319
18 19 i didn't understand it and then

4439
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:09,840
the fact that like lossless compression

4440
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:12,560
implies intelligence

4441
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:14,000
the day that i was shown that and then

4442
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:15,280
the third one is controversial

4443
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:17,359
the day i found a blog called

4444
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:20,479
unqualified reservations

4445
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:22,160
and uh read that and i was like

4446
02:28:20,479 --> 02:28:24,000
wait which one is that that's uh what's

4447
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:26,560
the guy's name curtis garvin

4448
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,600
yeah so many people tell me i'm supposed

4449
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:30,479
to talk to him

4450
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:31,200
yeah but he looks he sounds insane or

4451
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:33,439
brilliant

4452
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:35,200
but insane or both i don't know the day

4453
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:36,479
i found that blog was another like this

4454
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,920
was during like like

4455
02:28:36,479 --> 02:28:40,640
gamergate and kind of the run-up to the

4456
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:42,960
2016 election and i'm like

4457
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:44,880
wow okay the world makes sense now this

4458
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:46,160
this like i had a framework now to

4459
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:47,760
interpret this just like i got the

4460
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:49,840
framework for ai and a framework to

4461
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:51,680
interpret technological progress like

4462
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:53,600
those days when i discovered these new

4463
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:54,560
frameworks were oh interesting it's just

4464
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:57,040
not about

4465
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:58,640
but what was special about those days

4466
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:01,439
how did those days come to be

4467
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:02,800
is it just you got lucky like sure i

4468
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:05,040
like

4469
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:07,600
well you just encounter hutter prize on

4470
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:11,120
uh on hack news or something like that

4471
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:11,760
um like what but you see i don't think

4472
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:13,280
it's just

4473
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:14,800
see i don't think it's just that like i

4474
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:16,160
could have gotten lucky at any point i

4475
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:18,000
think that in a way

4476
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:21,359
you were ready at that moment yeah

4477
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:24,240
exactly to receive the information

4478
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:25,439
but is there some magic to the day today

4479
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:27,520
of like

4480
02:29:25,439 --> 02:29:28,960
like eating breakfast and it's the

4481
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:31,920
mundane things

4482
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:32,800
nah nothing no i drift i drift through

4483
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:35,120
life

4484
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:36,720
without structure i drift through life

4485
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:38,479
hoping and praying that i will get

4486
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:40,240
another day like those days

4487
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:42,960
and there's nothing in particular you do

4488
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:46,000
to uh to be a receptacle

4489
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:47,680
for another for day number four

4490
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:50,240
no i didn't do anything to get the other

4491
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:52,720
ones so i don't think i have to really

4492
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:54,479
do anything now i took a month-long trip

4493
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,600
to new york and

4494
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:56,800
i mean the ethereum thing was the

4495
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:57,840
highlight of it but the rest of it was

4496
02:29:56,800 --> 02:30:00,960
pretty terrible

4497
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:02,319
i did a two-week road trip and i got i

4498
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:05,280
had to turn around i had to turn around

4499
02:30:02,319 --> 02:30:06,960
i'm driving in uh

4500
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:09,040
in gunnison colorado i passed through

4501
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:11,120
gunnison and uh

4502
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:12,399
the snow starts coming down this path up

4503
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:13,359
there called monarch pass in order to

4504
02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:14,640
get through to denver you gotta get over

4505
02:30:13,359 --> 02:30:16,800
the rockies

4506
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:18,000
and i had to turn my car around i

4507
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:20,160
couldn't i watched

4508
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:23,200
i watched a f-150 go off the road i'm

4509
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:24,720
like i gotta go back and

4510
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:26,560
like that day was meaningful because

4511
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:28,479
like like it was real like i actually

4512
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:30,080
had to turn my car around

4513
02:30:28,479 --> 02:30:31,760
um it's rare that anything even real

4514
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:34,319
happens in my life even as

4515
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:35,040
you know mundane is the fact that yeah

4516
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:36,720
there was snow

4517
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:38,080
i had to turn around stay in gunnison

4518
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,800
and leave the next day something about

4519
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:42,319
that moment for

4520
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:43,840
real okay so actually it's interesting

4521
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:44,560
to break apart the three moments you

4522
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:47,680
mentioned

4523
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:49,040
if it's okay so uh i always have trouble

4524
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:52,640
pronouncing his name but

4525
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:52,640
allows yakowski yeah

4526
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:59,359
so what how did your

4527
02:30:56,399 --> 02:31:00,000
world view change in starting to

4528
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:03,439
consider

4529
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:03,760
the the exponential growth of ai and agi

4530
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:06,319
that

4531
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:07,840
he thinks about and the the the threats

4532
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:09,280
of artificial intelligence and all that

4533
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:11,840
kind of ideas like

4534
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:13,520
can you is it j like can you maybe uh

4535
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:15,840
break apart like what

4536
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:17,280
exactly was so magical to use a

4537
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:18,960
transformational experience

4538
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:21,280
today everyone knows him for threats and

4539
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:22,960
ai safety um this was pre

4540
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:25,280
that stuff there was i don't think a

4541
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:27,760
mention of ai safety on the page

4542
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:29,120
um this is this is old yukowski stuff

4543
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:30,640
he'd probably denounce it all now he'd

4544
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:31,920
probably be like that's exactly what i

4545
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:34,640
didn't want to happen

4546
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:34,640
well sorry man

4547
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,640
is there something specific you can take

4548
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:42,319
from his work that you can remember

4549
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:45,280
yeah uh it was this realization that

4550
02:31:42,319 --> 02:31:45,920
uh computers double in power every 18

4551
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:49,120
months

4552
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:50,080
and humans do not and they haven't

4553
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,439
crossed yet

4554
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:53,120
but if you have one thing that's

4555
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:54,720
doubling every 18 months and one thing

4556
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:57,120
that's staying like this

4557
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:58,080
you know here's your log graph here's

4558
02:31:57,120 --> 02:32:01,600
your line

4559
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:01,600
you know you calculate that

4560
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:05,120
and that did that open the door to the

4561
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:06,800
exponential thinking

4562
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:09,920
like thinking that like you know what

4563
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:11,439
with technology we can actually

4564
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:13,680
transformed the world

4565
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:15,840
it opened the door to human obsolescence

4566
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:17,120
it opened the door to realize that in my

4567
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:20,560
lifetime

4568
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:22,560
humans are going to be replaced

4569
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:24,160
and then the matching idea to that of

4570
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:26,560
artificial intelligence with the hutter

4571
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:26,560
prize

4572
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:30,160
you know i'm torn i go back and forth on

4573
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:33,520
what i think about it

4574
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:35,200
yeah but the the the basic thesis

4575
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:36,560
is it's nice to com it's a nice

4576
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:38,319
compelling notion that

4577
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:40,080
we can reduce the task of creating an

4578
02:32:38,319 --> 02:32:41,280
intelligent system a general

4579
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:44,399
intelligence system

4580
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:45,760
into the task of compression so you can

4581
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:46,800
think of all of intelligence in the

4582
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:50,080
universe in fact

4583
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:52,080
as a kind of compression

4584
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:53,840
do you find that was that just at the

4585
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:54,880
time you found that as a compelling idea

4586
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:57,600
do you still find that

4587
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:58,800
a compelling idea i still find that

4588
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,200
compelling idea

4589
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:02,160
um i think that it's not that useful day

4590
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:05,520
to day

4591
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:07,120
but actually um one of maybe my quests

4592
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:09,120
before that was a search for the

4593
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:12,240
definition of the word intelligence

4594
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:13,200
and i never had one and i definitely

4595
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:14,560
have a definition of the word

4596
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:17,359
compression

4597
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:18,319
it's a very uh simple uh straightforward

4598
02:33:17,359 --> 02:33:19,680
one

4599
02:33:18,319 --> 02:33:20,640
and uh you know what confession is you

4600
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:21,840
know what lossless is lossless

4601
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,880
compassion not lossy lossless

4602
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:24,960
compression

4603
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:26,479
and that that is equivalent to

4604
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:27,920
intelligence which i believe

4605
02:33:26,479 --> 02:33:29,920
i'm not sure how useful that definition

4606
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:32,160
is day to day but like i now have a

4607
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:35,200
framework to understand what it is

4608
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:36,880
and he just 10x 10xed the uh the prize

4609
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:37,600
for that competition like recently a few

4610
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:39,120
months ago

4611
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,880
you ever thought of taking a crack at

4612
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:43,840
that oh i did

4613
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:45,840
oh i did i spent i spent the next after

4614
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:48,479
i found the prize i spent the next

4615
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:49,680
six months of my life trying it and uh

4616
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:50,720
well that's when i started learning

4617
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:53,200
everything about

4618
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:54,160
ai and then i worked vicarious for a bit

4619
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:55,359
and then i learned

4620
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:57,040
read all the deep learning stuff and i'm

4621
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:58,319
like okay now i like i'm called up to

4622
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:59,920
modern ai

4623
02:33:58,319 --> 02:34:01,600
wow and i had i had a really good

4624
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:04,000
framework to put it all in from the

4625
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:05,680
compression stuff

4626
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,040
right like some of the first uh some of

4627
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,760
the first deep learning models i played

4628
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:11,359
with were

4629
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:13,200
uh like gpt basically but before

4630
02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:16,720
transformers before it was still

4631
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:18,800
uh rnn's to to do uh

4632
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:19,840
character prediction but by the way on

4633
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:22,800
the compression side

4634
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:24,560
i mean the especially neural networks

4635
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:27,760
what do you make of the lossless

4636
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:30,880
requirement with the hudder prize so

4637
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:32,319
you know human intelligence and neural

4638
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:35,120
networks can probably compress

4639
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:36,240
stuff pretty well but it would be lossy

4640
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:37,920
it's imperfect

4641
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:39,520
uh you can turn a lossy compressor into

4642
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:41,120
a lossless compressor pretty easily

4643
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:42,560
using an arithmetic encoder right you

4644
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:44,640
can take an arithmetic encoder

4645
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:45,920
and you can just encode the noise with

4646
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:48,319
maximum efficiency

4647
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:50,399
right so even if you can't predict

4648
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:52,479
exactly what the next character is

4649
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:54,160
the better a probability distribution

4650
02:34:52,479 --> 02:34:56,080
you can put over the next character

4651
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:57,920
you can then use an arithmetic encoder

4652
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:59,120
to uh right you don't have to know

4653
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:00,720
whether it's an e or an i

4654
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:02,880
you just have to put good probabilities

4655
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:04,960
on them and then you know code those

4656
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:06,319
and if you have it's a bits of entropy

4657
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:07,840
thing right

4658
02:35:06,319 --> 02:35:09,520
so let me on that topic could be

4659
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:11,680
interesting as a little side

4660
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:13,439
tour what are your thoughts in this year

4661
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:14,960
about gpt3

4662
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:16,880
and these language models and these

4663
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:17,840
transformers is there something

4664
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:21,120
interesting

4665
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:22,479
to you as an ai researcher or is there

4666
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:25,280
something interesting to you

4667
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:26,319
as an autonomous vehicle developer nah i

4668
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:27,840
think uh

4669
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:30,080
i think it's overhyped i mean it's not

4670
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:30,720
like it's cool it's cool for what it is

4671
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:32,240
but no

4672
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:33,840
we're not just going to be able to scale

4673
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:36,080
up to gpg 12 and get

4674
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:37,040
general-purpose intelligence like your

4675
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:39,439
loss function

4676
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:41,120
is literally just you know you know

4677
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:42,479
cross-entropy loss on the character

4678
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:44,720
right like that's not the loss function

4679
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:47,760
of general intelligence

4680
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:49,359
is that obvious to you yes can you

4681
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:52,800
imagine

4682
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:53,760
that like to play devil's advocate on

4683
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:57,040
yourself is it

4684
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:58,479
possible that you can the gpt-12 will

4685
02:35:57,040 --> 02:36:00,960
achieve general intelligence

4686
02:35:58,479 --> 02:36:01,840
with something as dumb as this kind of

4687
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:03,600
loss function

4688
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:04,960
i guess it depends what you mean by

4689
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:07,840
general intelligence

4690
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:09,680
so there's another problem with the gpts

4691
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:12,960
and that's that they don't have

4692
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:16,640
a uh they don't have long-term memory

4693
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:20,840
right right so like just

4694
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:22,399
gpt 12 a scaled up version of gpt two or

4695
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:25,920
three

4696
02:36:22,399 --> 02:36:28,880
i find it hard to believe

4697
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:30,399
well you can scale it in it's yeah so

4698
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:33,120
it's a hardcore

4699
02:36:30,399 --> 02:36:36,319
hard-coded length but you can make it

4700
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:38,479
wider and wider and wider yeah

4701
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:40,880
you're gonna get you're gonna get cool

4702
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:44,160
things from those systems

4703
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:45,680
but i i don't think you're ever gonna

4704
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:47,680
get something that can like

4705
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:49,439
you know build me a rocket ship what

4706
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:52,720
about solve driving

4707
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:54,640
so you know you can use transformer with

4708
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:57,520
video for example

4709
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:58,319
you think is there something in there no

4710
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:01,600
because

4711
02:36:58,319 --> 02:37:02,880
hey look we use we as a group we use a

4712
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:04,880
group we could change that group out to

4713
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:07,359
a transformer

4714
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:09,359
um i think driving is much more

4715
02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:11,680
markovian than language

4716
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:13,680
so markov you mean like the memory which

4717
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:16,319
which aspect of uh

4718
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:17,120
i mean that like most of the information

4719
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:19,280
in the state at t

4720
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:21,439
minus one is also in the in is in state

4721
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:21,760
t yeah right and it kind of like drops

4722
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:23,520
off

4723
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:25,120
nicely like this where sometime with

4724
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:27,200
language you have to refer back to the

4725
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:29,520
third paragraph on the second page

4726
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:30,960
i feel like there's not many like like

4727
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:32,479
you can say like speed limit signs but

4728
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:33,840
there's really not many things in

4729
02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:36,319
autonomous driving that look like that

4730
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:37,120
but if you look at uh to play devil's

4731
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:38,960
advocate

4732
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:40,080
is uh the risk estimation thing that

4733
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:41,120
you've talked about it's kind of

4734
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:43,920
interesting

4735
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:45,280
is uh it feels like there might be some

4736
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:48,080
longer term

4737
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:50,240
uh aggregation of context necessary to

4738
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:53,439
be able to figure out like

4739
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:56,080
the context yeah i'm not even sure i'm

4740
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:58,160
i'm believing my my own devil's we have

4741
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:59,680
a nice we have a nice like vision model

4742
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:01,359
which outputs like a a

4743
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:03,200
one two four dimensional perception

4744
02:38:01,359 --> 02:38:05,200
space um

4745
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:06,479
can i try transformers on it sure i

4746
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:08,240
probably will

4747
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:09,680
at some point we'll try transformers and

4748
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,080
then we'll just see do they do better

4749
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:12,000
sure

4750
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:13,520
i'm well it might not be a game changer

4751
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,960
no well i'm not like like

4752
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:16,640
might transformers work better than

4753
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:18,319
grooves for autonomous driving sure

4754
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:19,920
might we switch sure is this some

4755
02:38:18,319 --> 02:38:21,520
radical change no

4756
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:23,040
okay we use a slightly different you

4757
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:24,399
know we switch from rnns to grooves

4758
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:26,479
like okay maybe it's greased to

4759
02:38:24,399 --> 02:38:29,680
transformers but no it's not

4760
02:38:26,479 --> 02:38:30,880
yeah i well on the on the topic of

4761
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:32,160
general intelligence i don't know

4762
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:34,800
how much i've talked to you about it

4763
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:37,920
like what um

4764
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:39,840
do you think will actually build an agi

4765
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:41,200
like if if you look at ray kurzweil with

4766
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:43,520
a singularity do

4767
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:45,280
you have like an intuition about you're

4768
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:48,479
kind of saying driving is easy

4769
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:50,720
yeah and i

4770
02:38:48,479 --> 02:38:52,479
i tend to personally believe that

4771
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:55,840
solving driving

4772
02:38:52,479 --> 02:38:58,160
will have really deep important

4773
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:59,200
impacts on our ability to solve general

4774
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:01,920
intelligence

4775
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:03,280
like i i think driving doesn't require

4776
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:04,560
general intelligence

4777
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:07,280
but i think they're going to be

4778
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:08,240
neighbors in a way that it's like deeply

4779
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:10,560
tied

4780
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:13,200
because it's so like driving is so

4781
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:16,560
deeply connected to the human experience

4782
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:17,359
that i think solving one will help solve

4783
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:19,760
the other

4784
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:20,479
but but so i don't see i don't see

4785
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:22,240
driving is like

4786
02:39:20,479 --> 02:39:24,240
easy and almost like separate than

4787
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,640
general intelligence but like what's

4788
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:26,720
your

4789
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:28,240
vision of a future with a singular do

4790
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:29,920
you see there'll be a single moment like

4791
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:30,479
a singularity where it'll be a phase

4792
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:32,720
shift

4793
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:34,479
are we in the singularity now like what

4794
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:35,040
do you have crazy ideas about the future

4795
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:36,960
in terms of

4796
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:38,640
agi we're definitely in the singularity

4797
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:40,800
now um we are

4798
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:42,080
coolers of course look at the bandwidth

4799
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:43,200
between people the bandwidth between

4800
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:45,920
people goes up

4801
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:47,120
all right um the singularity is just you

4802
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:48,240
know when the bandwidth but

4803
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:50,080
what do you mean by the bandwidth of the

4804
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:51,200
people communications tools the whole

4805
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:52,399
world is networked

4806
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:54,560
the whole world is networked and we

4807
02:39:52,399 --> 02:39:56,240
raise the speed of that network right

4808
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:57,760
oh so you think the communication of

4809
02:39:56,240 --> 02:40:00,880
information in a

4810
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:02,240
distributed way is a empowering thing

4811
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:03,439
for collective intelligence

4812
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:04,640
oh i didn't say it's necessarily a good

4813
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:05,600
thing but i think that's like when i

4814
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:08,000
think of the definition of the

4815
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:12,000
singularity yeah it seems kind of right

4816
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:13,439
i see like it's a change in the world

4817
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,120
beyond which

4818
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:16,880
like the world be transformed in ways

4819
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:18,399
that we can't possibly imagine no i mean

4820
02:40:16,880 --> 02:40:19,840
i think we're in the singularity now in

4821
02:40:18,399 --> 02:40:21,520
the sense that there's like you know one

4822
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:22,319
world and a monoculture and it's also

4823
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:24,240
linked

4824
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:25,600
yeah i mean i i kind of shared the

4825
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:27,840
intuition that

4826
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:30,160
the the singularity will originate from

4827
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:33,200
the collective intelligence

4828
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:34,319
of us ants versus the like some single

4829
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:36,880
system agi

4830
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:38,640
type thing oh i totally agree with that

4831
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:40,720
yeah i don't i don't really believe in

4832
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:42,960
like like a hard take off agi kind of

4833
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:42,960
thing

4834
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:48,160
um yeah i don't think i don't even think

4835
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:50,560
ai is all that different

4836
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:51,520
in kind from what we've already been

4837
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:54,399
building

4838
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:55,680
um with respect to driving i think

4839
02:40:54,399 --> 02:40:56,960
driving is a subset of general

4840
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:58,000
intelligence and i think it's a pretty

4841
02:40:56,960 --> 02:41:00,160
complete subset

4842
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:02,160
i think the tools we develop at comma

4843
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:04,240
will also be extremely helpful

4844
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:05,760
to solving general intelligence and

4845
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:06,399
that's i think the real reason why i'm

4846
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:08,240
doing it

4847
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:10,880
i don't care about self-driving cars

4848
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:12,960
it's a cool problem to beat people at

4849
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:14,399
but yeah i mean yeah you're kind of

4850
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:16,319
you're of two minds

4851
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:17,920
so one you do have to have a mission and

4852
02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:20,560
you want to focus and make sure you

4853
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:21,359
get you get there you can't forget that

4854
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:23,840
but

4855
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:25,520
at the same time there is a thread

4856
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:27,760
that's much

4857
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:29,200
bigger than uh the connects the entirety

4858
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:31,120
of your effort that's much bigger than

4859
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:33,439
just driving

4860
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:35,040
with ai and with general intelligence it

4861
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:36,240
is so easy to delude yourself

4862
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:38,399
into thinking you've figured something

4863
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:39,760
out when you haven't if we build a level

4864
02:41:38,399 --> 02:41:42,640
5 self-driving car

4865
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:43,279
we have indisputably built something

4866
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:45,040
yeah

4867
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:46,880
is it general intelligence i'm not going

4868
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:47,439
to debate that i will say we've built

4869
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:49,840
something

4870
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:51,359
that provides huge financial value yeah

4871
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:53,600
beautifully put that's the engineering

4872
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:55,680
credo like just just build the thing

4873
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:57,680
it's like that's why i'm with uh with

4874
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:59,840
the with elon on uh

4875
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:00,720
go to mars yeah that's a great one you

4876
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:03,520
can argue like

4877
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:05,120
who the hell cares about going to mars

4878
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:07,359
but the reality is

4879
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:09,040
set that as a mission get it done yeah

4880
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:11,520
and then you're going to crack some pro

4881
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:13,760
problem that you've never even expected

4882
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:16,080
in the process of doing that yeah

4883
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:17,439
yeah i mean no i think if i had a choice

4884
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:18,800
between humanity going to mars and

4885
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:20,720
solving self-driving cars i think going

4886
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:22,319
to mars is uh

4887
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:24,080
better but i don't know i'm more suited

4888
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:25,120
for self-driving cars i'm an information

4889
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:26,399
guy i'm not a modernist i'm a

4890
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:29,520
postmodernist

4891
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:30,960
post modernist all right beautifully put

4892
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,800
let me let me drag you back to

4893
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:34,560
programming for a sec what

4894
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:36,000
three maybe three to five programming

4895
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:37,359
languages should people learn

4896
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:39,520
do you think like if you look at

4897
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:40,960
yourself what did you get the most out

4898
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:44,160
of

4899
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:44,800
from learning uh well so everybody

4900
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:46,479
should learn

4901
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:48,080
c and assembly we'll start with those

4902
02:42:46,479 --> 02:42:50,000
two right assembly

4903
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:51,600
yeah if you can't code in assembly you

4904
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,680
don't know what the computer's doing

4905
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:55,600
you don't understand like you don't have

4906
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:57,920
to be great in assembly but you have to

4907
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:59,200
code in it and then like you have to

4908
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:00,800
appreciate assembly in order to

4909
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:03,040
appreciate all the great things c

4910
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:04,479
gets you and then you have to code and

4911
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,160
see in order to appreciate all the great

4912
02:43:04,479 --> 02:43:07,760
things python gets you

4913
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:09,760
so i'll just say assembly c and python

4914
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:12,880
we'll start with those three

4915
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:15,920
the memory allocation of of c and the

4916
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:17,279
the the fact that so assemblies give you

4917
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:18,560
a sense of just how many levels of

4918
02:43:17,279 --> 02:43:20,240
abstraction

4919
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:22,319
you get to work on in modern day

4920
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:23,760
programs yeah yeah graph coloring for

4921
02:43:22,319 --> 02:43:25,680
assignment register assignment and

4922
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:26,880
compilers yeah like you know you got to

4923
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,240
do you know the compiler your computer

4924
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:29,600
only has a certain number of registers

4925
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:30,000
you can have all the variables you want

4926
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:31,680
a c

4927
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:33,520
function you know so you get to start

4928
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:35,439
your build intuition about

4929
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:37,279
compilation like what a compiler gets

4930
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:39,279
you

4931
02:43:37,279 --> 02:43:41,120
what else um well then there's then

4932
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:42,880
there's kind of uh

4933
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:45,680
so those are all very imperative

4934
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:47,200
programming languages um

4935
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:48,319
then there's two other paradigms for

4936
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:49,040
programming that everybody should be

4937
02:43:48,319 --> 02:43:51,279
familiar with

4938
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:53,040
i'm one of them is functional uh you

4939
02:43:51,279 --> 02:43:54,080
should learn haskell and take that all

4940
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:55,439
the way through

4941
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:57,279
learn a language with dependent types

4942
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:00,000
like

4943
02:43:57,279 --> 02:44:00,720
learn that whole space like the very pl

4944
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,359
theory

4945
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:04,479
heavy languages and haskell is your

4946
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:06,399
favorite functional

4947
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:08,399
what is that the go-to you would say

4948
02:44:06,399 --> 02:44:08,720
yeah i'm not a great haskell programmer

4949
02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:10,640
i

4950
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:11,760
wrote a compiler in haskell once there's

4951
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:12,960
another paradigm and actually there's

4952
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:13,600
one more paradigm that i'll even talk

4953
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:14,800
about

4954
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:16,319
after that that i never used to talk

4955
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:17,760
about when i would think about this but

4956
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:19,279
the next paradigm is learn verilog of

4957
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:21,760
hdl

4958
02:44:19,279 --> 02:44:24,960
um understand this idea of all of the

4959
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:24,960
instructions execute at once

4960
02:44:25,359 --> 02:44:28,560
if i have a block in verilog and i write

4961
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:30,840
stuff in it

4962
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:33,600
it's not sequential they all execute it

4963
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:34,880
once

4964
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:36,640
and then like think like that that's how

4965
02:44:34,880 --> 02:44:39,279
hardware works

4966
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:39,920
to be so i guess assembly doesn't quite

4967
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:42,240
get you that

4968
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:44,160
assembly's more about compilation and

4969
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:46,800
verilog is more about the hardware

4970
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:48,479
like giving a sense of what actually is

4971
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:50,960
the hardware is doing

4972
02:44:48,479 --> 02:44:53,120
assembly c python are straight like they

4973
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:55,359
sit right on top of each other in fact c

4974
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:56,800
is well let's see it's kind of coded in

4975
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:58,479
c but you could imagine the first c was

4976
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:59,520
coded in assembly and python is actually

4977
02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:02,080
coded in c

4978
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:03,600
um so you know you can straight up go on

4979
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:05,760
that

4980
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:06,960
got it and then verilog gives you that's

4981
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:08,800
brilliant

4982
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:10,960
okay and then i think there's another

4983
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:12,560
one now everyone should carpathi calls

4984
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:16,399
it programming 2.0

4985
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:18,720
which is learn a i'm not even gonna

4986
02:45:16,399 --> 02:45:20,000
don't learn tensorflow learn pi torch so

4987
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:21,359
machine learning

4988
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:25,120
we've got to come up with a better term

4989
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:25,120
than programming 2.0 or um

4990
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:28,880
but yeah it's a programming language

4991
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:33,040
i wonder if it could be formalized a

4992
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:34,640
little bit better which we feels like

4993
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:36,960
we're in the early days

4994
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:39,040
of what that actually entails

4995
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:42,080
data-driven programming

4996
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:43,840
data-driven programming yeah but it's so

4997
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:46,560
fundamentally different as a paradigm

4998
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:49,920
than the others uh like it almost

4999
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:49,920
requires a different skill set

5000
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:53,439
but you think it's still yeah

5001
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:57,600
and ply torch versus tensorflow pytorch

5002
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:59,279
wins it's the fourth paradigm it's the

5003
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:02,399
fourth paradigm that i've kind of seen

5004
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:05,120
there's like this you know imperative

5005
02:46:02,399 --> 02:46:06,240
functional hardware i don't know a

5006
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:11,439
better word for it

5007
02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:14,560
and then ml do you have advice

5008
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:15,600
for people uh that want to you know get

5009
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:17,120
into programming want to learn

5010
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:21,120
programming you have a

5011
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:22,800
a video uh what is programming new

5012
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:24,640
blessings exclamation point

5013
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:27,120
and i think the top comment is like

5014
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:30,800
warning this is not for noobs

5015
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:34,640
uh do you have a noob like uh

5016
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:38,399
tldw for that video but also uh

5017
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:39,760
a new but friendly advice on

5018
02:46:38,399 --> 02:46:41,520
how to get into programming you are

5019
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:42,880
never going to learn programming by

5020
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:45,359
watching a video

5021
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:46,880
called learn programming the only way to

5022
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:48,080
learn programming i think and the only

5023
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:49,600
one is the only way

5024
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:52,000
everyone i've ever met who can program

5025
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:54,800
well learned it all in the same way they

5026
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:56,720
had something they wanted to do

5027
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:58,160
and then they tried to do it and then

5028
02:46:56,720 --> 02:47:01,040
they were like

5029
02:46:58,160 --> 02:47:02,399
oh well okay this is kind of you know be

5030
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,279
nice if the computer could kind of do

5031
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:04,640
this thing and then

5032
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:07,840
you know that's how you learn you just

5033
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:07,840
keep pushing on a project

5034
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:12,000
um so the only advice i have for

5035
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:14,720
learning programming is go program

5036
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,760
somebody wrote to me a question like we

5037
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:17,600
don't really

5038
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:18,880
they're looking to learn about recurring

5039
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:20,399
neural networks

5040
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:22,080
he's saying like my company is thinking

5041
02:47:20,399 --> 02:47:24,000
of doing recruit using recurring neural

5042
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:25,840
networks for time series data

5043
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,279
but we don't really have an idea of

5044
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:28,560
where to use it yet

5045
02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:30,560
we just want to like do you have any

5046
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:32,319
advice on how to learn about

5047
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:34,240
these are these kind of general machine

5048
02:47:32,319 --> 02:47:37,279
learning questions and i think

5049
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:38,479
the answer is like actually

5050
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:41,200
have a problem that you're trying to

5051
02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:42,479
solve and and just i see that stuff oh

5052
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:43,279
my god when people talk like that

5053
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:45,359
they're like

5054
02:47:43,279 --> 02:47:47,040
i heard machine learning's important

5055
02:47:45,359 --> 02:47:48,640
could you help us integrate machine

5056
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:51,120
learning with macaroni and cheese

5057
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:53,040
production

5058
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:55,200
you just i don't even you can't help

5059
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:57,040
these people like who lets you run

5060
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:58,240
anything who lets that kind of person

5061
02:47:57,040 --> 02:48:01,200
run anything

5062
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:02,560
i think we're we're all um we're all

5063
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:05,040
beginners at some point

5064
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:06,000
so it's not like they're a beginner it's

5065
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:07,200
it's like

5066
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:09,120
my problem is not that they don't know

5067
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:09,920
about machine learning my problem is

5068
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:11,520
that they think that

5069
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:14,479
machine learning has something to say

5070
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:16,160
about macaroni and cheese production

5071
02:48:14,479 --> 02:48:19,680
or like i heard about this new

5072
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:21,680
technology how can i use it for why

5073
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:23,439
like i don't know what it is but how can

5074
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:24,960
i use it for why

5075
02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:26,640
that's true you have to build up an

5076
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:28,080
intuition of how because you might be

5077
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:29,760
able to figure out a way but

5078
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:31,760
like the prerequisites you should have a

5079
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:32,160
macaroni and cheese problem to solve

5080
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:35,359
first

5081
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:37,520
exactly and then two you should

5082
02:48:35,359 --> 02:48:39,279
have more traditional like in the

5083
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:41,840
learning process should involve

5084
02:48:39,279 --> 02:48:43,439
more traditionally applicable problems

5085
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:44,479
in the space of whatever that is of

5086
02:48:43,439 --> 02:48:46,640
machine learning

5087
02:48:44,479 --> 02:48:48,160
and then see if it could be applied to

5088
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:49,680
background at least start with tell me

5089
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:50,560
about a problem like if you have a

5090
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:52,319
problem you're like

5091
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:53,840
you know some of my boxes aren't getting

5092
02:48:52,319 --> 02:48:55,840
enough macaroni in them

5093
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:57,200
um can we use machine learning to solve

5094
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:59,279
this problem that's

5095
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:01,520
much much better than how do i apply

5096
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:04,800
machine learning to macaroni and cheese

5097
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:06,319
one big thing maybe this is me uh

5098
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:08,000
talking to the audience a little bit

5099
02:49:06,319 --> 02:49:12,399
because i get these days

5100
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:15,920
so many messages a device on how to like

5101
02:49:12,399 --> 02:49:18,160
learn stuff okay my

5102
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:20,560
this this this is not me being mean i

5103
02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:24,840
think this is quite a profound actually

5104
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:27,200
is you should google it oh yeah

5105
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:28,960
like one of the uh

5106
02:49:27,200 --> 02:49:31,040
like skills that you should really

5107
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:34,000
acquire as an engineer

5108
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:34,880
as a researcher as a thinker like one

5109
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:37,840
there's two

5110
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:39,359
two complementary skills like one is

5111
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:41,520
with a blank sheet of paper with no

5112
02:49:39,359 --> 02:49:44,640
internet to think deeply

5113
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:46,160
and then the other is to google the crap

5114
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:47,520
out of the questions you have like

5115
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:49,760
that's actually a skill i

5116
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:51,600
don't people often talk about but like

5117
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:53,840
doing research like pulling at the

5118
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:55,359
thread like looking up different words

5119
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:58,160
going into like

5120
02:49:55,359 --> 02:49:59,920
github repositories with two stars and

5121
02:49:58,160 --> 02:50:03,359
like looking how they did stuff like

5122
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:04,960
looking at the code or going on twitter

5123
02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:06,479
seeing like there's little pockets of

5124
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:07,439
brilliant people that are like having

5125
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:10,160
discussions

5126
02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:12,000
like if you're a neuroscientist go into

5127
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:14,720
signal processing community if you're an

5128
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:17,279
ai person going into the

5129
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:18,800
psychology community like like switch

5130
02:50:17,279 --> 02:50:19,840
communities that keep searching

5131
02:50:18,800 --> 02:50:22,880
searching searching

5132
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:25,680
because it's so much better

5133
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:28,319
to invest in like finding somebody else

5134
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:29,920
who already solved your problem

5135
02:50:28,319 --> 02:50:32,000
than than this to try to solve the

5136
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:34,560
problem and because they've

5137
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:36,000
often invested years of their life like

5138
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:37,600
entire communities

5139
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:39,120
are probably already out there who have

5140
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:41,920
tried to solve your problem

5141
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:44,080
i think they're the same thing i think

5142
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:46,080
you go try to solve the problem

5143
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:47,680
and then in trying to solve the problem

5144
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:48,880
if you're good at solving problems

5145
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:50,160
you'll stumble upon the person who

5146
02:50:48,880 --> 02:50:52,560
solved it already yeah

5147
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:53,760
but the stumbling is really important i

5148
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:56,160
think that's a skill that people should

5149
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:58,800
really approach especially in undergrad

5150
02:50:56,160 --> 02:51:00,960
like search if you ask me a question how

5151
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:04,080
should i get started in deep learning

5152
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:08,000
like especially

5153
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:10,080
like that is just so google like

5154
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,520
the whole point is you google that and

5155
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:14,399
you get a million pages

5156
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:15,680
and just start looking at them yeah

5157
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:17,920
start pulling at the thread

5158
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:18,720
start exploring start taking notes start

5159
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:20,080
getting it

5160
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:22,000
advice from a million people that

5161
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:25,040
already like spent their

5162
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:26,240
life answering that question actually oh

5163
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:27,520
well yeah i mean that's definitely also

5164
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:29,120
yeah when people like ask me things like

5165
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:30,800
that i'm like trust me the top answer on

5166
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:32,000
google is much much better than anything

5167
02:51:30,800 --> 02:51:35,840
i'm going to tell you

5168
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:38,399
right yeah people ask

5169
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:40,160
it's an interesting question let me know

5170
02:51:38,399 --> 02:51:41,200
if you have any recommendations what

5171
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:43,600
three books

5172
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:44,880
technical or fiction or philosophical

5173
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:46,960
had an impact

5174
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:49,040
on your life or you would recommend

5175
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:50,000
perhaps uh

5176
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:52,960
maybe we'll start with the least

5177
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:57,359
controversial uh infinite jest

5178
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:59,359
um infinite jest is a

5179
02:51:57,359 --> 02:52:02,640
david foster wallace yeah it's a book

5180
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:02,640
about wireheading really

5181
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:07,359
very enjoyable to read very uh

5182
02:52:06,319 --> 02:52:08,880
well-written

5183
02:52:07,359 --> 02:52:10,640
you know you will you will you will grow

5184
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:13,840
as a person reading this book

5185
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:16,000
uh it's effort um and i'll set that up

5186
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:19,359
for the second book which is pornography

5187
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:22,640
it's called atlas shrugged um

5188
02:52:19,359 --> 02:52:24,640
uh which um atlas drug is pornography

5189
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:26,800
i mean it is i will not i will not

5190
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:28,399
defend the i will not say atlas shrugged

5191
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:30,319
is a well-written book

5192
02:52:28,399 --> 02:52:31,439
it is entertaining to read certainly

5193
02:52:30,319 --> 02:52:33,760
just like pornography

5194
02:52:31,439 --> 02:52:35,439
the production value isn't great um you

5195
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:36,960
know there's a 60-page

5196
02:52:35,439 --> 02:52:38,800
monologue in there that ann rand's

5197
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:42,080
editor really wanted to take out

5198
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:44,560
and she uh paid she paid out of her

5199
02:52:42,080 --> 02:52:45,359
pocket to keep that 60 page monologue in

5200
02:52:44,560 --> 02:52:50,479
the book

5201
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:54,560
um but it is a great book for a kind of

5202
02:52:50,479 --> 02:52:56,000
framework um of human relations

5203
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:58,000
and i know a lot of people are like yeah

5204
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,800
but it's a terrible framework

5205
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:01,520
yeah but it's a framework just for

5206
02:53:00,800 --> 02:53:04,160
context

5207
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:04,720
in a couple days i'm speaking with for

5208
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:06,720
uh

5209
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:08,960
probably four plus hours with euron

5210
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:12,160
brook who's

5211
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:15,200
the main living remaining objectivists

5212
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:18,720
objectivist interesting uh so

5213
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:21,399
i've always found this philosophy quite

5214
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:23,040
interesting on many levels one of how

5215
02:53:21,399 --> 02:53:24,720
repulsive

5216
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:26,080
some percent of large percent of the

5217
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:29,040
population find it

5218
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:29,680
which is always uh always funny to me

5219
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:32,160
when people

5220
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:32,960
are like unable to even read a

5221
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:36,319
philosophy

5222
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:39,279
because uh of some i think that says

5223
02:53:36,319 --> 02:53:40,479
more about their psychological

5224
02:53:39,279 --> 02:53:44,399
perspective on it

5225
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:47,600
yeah but but there is something about

5226
02:53:44,399 --> 02:53:49,520
objectivism and iran's philosophy that's

5227
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,640
very deeply connected to this idea of

5228
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:54,000
capitalism

5229
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:55,920
of uh the ethical life is the productive

5230
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:59,040
life

5231
02:53:55,920 --> 02:54:01,840
um that was always um

5232
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:03,279
compelling to me it didn't seem as like

5233
02:54:01,840 --> 02:54:05,439
i didn't seem to interpret it in the

5234
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:06,720
negative sense that some people do

5235
02:54:05,439 --> 02:54:09,120
to be fair i read that book when i was

5236
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:09,520
19. so you had an impact at that point

5237
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:12,800
yeah

5238
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:14,560
yeah and the the bad guys in the book

5239
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:16,240
have this slogan from each according to

5240
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:17,200
their ability to each according to their

5241
02:54:16,240 --> 02:54:19,600
need

5242
02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:20,880
and i'm looking at this and i'm like

5243
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:22,560
these are the most cards this is team

5244
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:24,240
rocket level cartoonishness

5245
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:25,680
right no bad guy and then when i

5246
02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:27,279
realized that was actually the slogan of

5247
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:30,880
the communist party

5248
02:54:27,279 --> 02:54:32,840
i'm like wait a second wait no no no no

5249
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:35,040
no just you're telling me this really

5250
02:54:32,840 --> 02:54:37,120
happened yeah it's interesting i mean

5251
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:39,120
one of the criticisms of her work is she

5252
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:40,160
has a cartoonish view of good and evil

5253
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:43,200
like

5254
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:44,479
that there's like the the reality isn't

5255
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:46,800
jordan peterson says this

5256
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:48,960
is that each of us have the capacity for

5257
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:50,399
good and evil in us as opposed to like

5258
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:52,080
there's some characters who are purely

5259
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:53,359
evil and some characters are purely good

5260
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:55,120
and that's in a way why it's

5261
02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:57,600
pornographic

5262
02:54:55,120 --> 02:54:59,520
the production value i love it well evil

5263
02:54:57,600 --> 02:55:02,560
is punished and there's very clearly

5264
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:05,520
you know there's no there's no you know

5265
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:07,359
uh just like porn doesn't have uh you

5266
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:09,439
know like character growth well you know

5267
02:55:07,359 --> 02:55:12,160
neither does alex shrugged like

5268
02:55:09,439 --> 02:55:13,439
brilliant well put but as a 19 year old

5269
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:15,760
george cotts it was

5270
02:55:13,439 --> 02:55:16,800
it was good enough yeah yeah what uh

5271
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:19,680
what's the third

5272
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:21,359
you have something um i i could give

5273
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:23,840
these these two i'll just throw out uh

5274
02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:25,200
there's sci-fi uh permutation city

5275
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:28,560
um great things to start thinking about

5276
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:31,600
copies of yourself and then um

5277
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:33,200
that is uh greg egan

5278
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:34,800
uh he's uh that might not be his real

5279
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:35,600
name some australian guy might not be

5280
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:38,000
australian

5281
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:39,840
i don't know um and then this one's

5282
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:42,080
online it's called the metamorphosis of

5283
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:44,399
prime intellect

5284
02:55:42,080 --> 02:55:46,640
um it's a story set in a

5285
02:55:44,399 --> 02:55:48,560
post-singularity world it's interesting

5286
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:50,160
is there uh can you if either of the

5287
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:51,680
worlds do you find something uh

5288
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:53,520
philosophy interesting in them that you

5289
02:55:51,680 --> 02:55:57,920
can comment on

5290
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:59,359
i mean it is clear to me that uh

5291
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:00,479
metamorphosis prime intellect is like

5292
02:55:59,359 --> 02:56:05,200
written by

5293
02:56:00,479 --> 02:56:05,200
an engineer uh which is

5294
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:12,479
it's very it's very almost a pragmatic

5295
02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:15,840
take on a utopia in a way

5296
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:17,840
positive or negative well that's up to

5297
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:20,880
you to decide reading the book

5298
02:56:17,840 --> 02:56:23,520
and the ending of it is very interesting

5299
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:25,200
as well and i didn't realize what it was

5300
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:26,560
i first read that when i was 15. i've

5301
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:27,359
reread that book several times in my

5302
02:56:26,560 --> 02:56:29,279
life

5303
02:56:27,359 --> 02:56:30,720
and it's sure it's 50 pages everyone

5304
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:33,040
should go read it

5305
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:34,560
what's uh sorry this is a little tangent

5306
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:36,479
i've been working through the foundation

5307
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:38,720
i've been i've haven't read much sci-fi

5308
02:56:36,479 --> 02:56:40,880
my whole life and i'm trying to fix that

5309
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:42,080
the last few months that's been a little

5310
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:44,640
side project

5311
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:45,840
what's uh to use the greatest sci-fi

5312
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:48,560
novel

5313
02:56:45,840 --> 02:56:49,120
uh that uh people should read or is that

5314
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:50,640
or

5315
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:52,319
i mean i would yeah i would i would say

02:56:50,640 --> 02:56:53,359
like yeah permutation city metamorphosis

5317
02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:54,960
environmental i got it

5318
02:56:53,359 --> 02:56:57,120

02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,080
lecture bach and if you want the

5333
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:25,040
controversial one

5334
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:25,040
bronze age mindset

5335
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:28,640
all right i'll look into that one those

5336
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:32,479
aren't sci-fi

5337
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:34,240
but just to round out books so

5338
02:57:32,479 --> 02:57:36,800
a bunch of people asked me on twitter

5339
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:38,640
and read it and so on for advice

5340
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:41,439
so what advice would you give a young

5341
02:57:38,640 --> 02:57:43,920
person today about life

5342
02:57:41,439 --> 02:57:43,920
another way

5343
02:57:44,720 --> 02:57:48,319
what uh yeah i mean looking back

5344
02:57:47,439 --> 02:57:51,279
especially when you're

5345
02:57:48,319 --> 02:57:51,520
young younger you did and you continued

5346
02:57:51,279 --> 02:57:54,319
it

5347
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:54,800
you've accomplished a lot of interesting

5348
02:57:54,319 --> 02:57:59,120
things

5349
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:59,120
is there some advice from those

5350
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:04,000
i'm that life of yours that you can pass

5351
02:58:01,439 --> 02:58:07,200
on if college ever opens again i would

5352
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:09,840
love to give a graduation speech

5353
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:11,680
um at that point i will put a lot of

5354
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:12,240
somewhat satirical effort into this

5355
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:14,479
question

5356
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:15,760
yeah at this you haven't written

5357
02:58:14,479 --> 02:58:18,080
anything at this point

5358
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:19,439
oh you know what always wear sunscreen

5359
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:22,960
this is water

5360
02:58:19,439 --> 02:58:25,359
like you're plagiarizing i mean you know

5361
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:26,080
but that's the that's the like clean

5362
02:58:25,359 --> 02:58:27,600
your room

5363
02:58:26,080 --> 02:58:33,200
you know yeah you can play drugs from

5364
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:36,800
from all this stuff and it's it's

5365
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:38,080
there is no self-help books aren't

5366
02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:39,920
designed to help you they're designed to

5367
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:42,880
make you feel good

5368
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:44,000
like whatever advice i could give you

5369
02:58:42,880 --> 02:58:46,640
already know

5370
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:49,200
everyone already knows sorry it doesn't

5371
02:58:46,640 --> 02:58:49,200
feel good

5372
02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:53,359
right like you know you know what what

5373
02:58:52,960 --> 02:58:56,800
if

5374
02:58:53,359 --> 02:59:00,080
if i tell you that you should you know

5375
02:58:56,800 --> 02:59:02,160
eat well and and and read more and

5376
02:59:00,080 --> 02:59:04,160
it's not gonna do anything i think the

5377
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:05,040
whole like genre of those kind of

5378
02:59:04,160 --> 02:59:08,080
questions is

5379
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:08,560
is is meaningless i don't know if

5380
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:10,160
anything

5381
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:12,399
it's don't worry so much about that

5382
02:59:10,160 --> 02:59:14,880
stuff don't be so caught up in your head

5383
02:59:12,399 --> 02:59:16,240
right i mean you're yeah in the sense

5384
02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:18,640
that your whole life

5385
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:20,560
is your whole existence is like moving

5386
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:23,760
version of that advice

5387
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:25,600
i don't know yeah

5388
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:27,279
there's there's something i mean there's

5389
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:28,960
something in you that resists that kind

5390
02:59:27,279 --> 02:59:33,359
of thinking and that in itself

5391
02:59:28,960 --> 02:59:35,120
is it's just illustrative of uh

5392
02:59:33,359 --> 02:59:36,640
who you are and there's something to

5393
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:38,399
learn from that

5394
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:41,279
i think you're you're clearly not

5395
02:59:38,399 --> 02:59:43,279
overthinking stuff

5396
02:59:41,279 --> 02:59:44,960
yeah and you know it's a gut thing i

5397
02:59:43,279 --> 02:59:47,279
even when i talk about my advice i'm

5398
02:59:44,960 --> 02:59:48,720
like my advice is only relevant to me

5399
02:59:47,279 --> 02:59:50,160
it's not relevant to anybody else i'm

5400
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:51,520
not saying you should go out if you're

5401
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:53,920
the kind of person who overthinks things

5402
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:55,279
to stop overthinking things it's not bad

5403
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:57,840
it doesn't work for me maybe it works

5404
02:59:55,279 --> 03:00:01,120
for you i you know i don't know

5405
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:03,520
let me ask you about love yeah

5406
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:05,040
uh so i think last time we talked about

5407
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:08,479
the meaning of life

5408
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:11,600
and it was it was kind of about winning

5409
03:00:08,479 --> 03:00:12,160
of course uh i don't think i've talked

5410
03:00:11,600 --> 03:00:14,880
to you about

5411
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:15,520
love much whether romantic or just love

5412
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:18,640
for

5413
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:21,439
the common humanity amongst us all what

5414
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:22,399
role has love played in your life in

5415
03:00:21,439 --> 03:00:24,960
this

5416
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:26,160
in this quest for winning where does

5417
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:28,880
love fit in

5418
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:30,240
well the word love i think means uh

5419
03:00:28,880 --> 03:00:32,560
several different things there's

5420
03:00:30,240 --> 03:00:33,840
uh love in the sense of maybe i could

5421
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:35,840
just say there's like love in the sense

5422
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:39,279
of opiates and love in the sense of

5423
03:00:35,840 --> 03:00:41,520
uh oxytocin and then love in the sense

5424
03:00:39,279 --> 03:00:41,520
of

5425
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:46,160
maybe like a love for math i don't think

5426
03:00:44,720 --> 03:00:47,600
fits into either those first two

5427
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:51,279
paradigms

5428
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:53,120
uh so each of those have they uh

5429
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:55,279
have they have they given something to

5430
03:00:53,120 --> 03:00:55,279
you

5431
03:00:55,439 --> 03:00:59,760
in your life i'm not that big of a fan

5432
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:02,960
of the first two

5433
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:02,960
um what

5434
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:07,600
the same reason i'm not a fan of you

5435
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:10,319
know the same reason i

5436
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:11,279
don't do opiates and don't take ecstasy

5437
03:01:10,319 --> 03:01:12,720
right

5438
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:15,279
and there were times look i've tried

5439
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:16,640
both um

5440
03:01:15,279 --> 03:01:21,520
i like opiates way more than i liked

5441
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:24,319
ecstasy uh but they're not

5442
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:25,120
the ethical life is the productive life

5443
03:01:24,319 --> 03:01:27,439
so maybe that's

5444
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:28,880
my problem with with those and then like

5445
03:01:27,439 --> 03:01:30,560
yeah a sense of

5446
03:01:28,880 --> 03:01:32,000
i don't know like abstract love for

5447
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:34,399
humanity

5448
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,439
i mean the abstract love for humanity

5449
03:01:34,399 --> 03:01:39,040
i'm like yeah i've always

5450
03:01:35,439 --> 03:01:40,640
felt that and i guess it's hard for me

5451
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:42,160
to imagine not feeling it and maybe

5452
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:44,319
there's people who don't and

5453
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:46,319
i don't know but yeah that's just like a

5454
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:48,560
background thing that's there

5455
03:01:46,319 --> 03:01:51,200
i mean since we brought up uh drugs let

5456
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:51,200
me ask you

5457
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:54,640
this is becoming more and more part of

5458
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:56,000
my life because i'm talking a few

5459
03:01:54,640 --> 03:01:57,600
researchers that are working on

5460
03:01:56,000 --> 03:02:00,479
psychedelics

5461
03:01:57,600 --> 03:02:00,800
i've eaten shrooms a couple times and it

5462
03:02:00,479 --> 03:02:03,359
was

5463
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:04,640
fascinating to me that like the mind can

5464
03:02:03,359 --> 03:02:07,760
go

5465
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:09,520
like it's fascinating the mine can go to

5466
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:09,920
places i didn't imagine it could go and

5467
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:12,160
it was

5468
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:13,200
very friendly and and positive and

5469
03:02:12,160 --> 03:02:15,520
exciting and

5470
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:17,040
everything was kind of hilarious in the

5471
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:18,160
in the place wherever my mind went

5472
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,840
that's where i went

5473
03:02:18,160 --> 03:02:22,800
is uh what do you think about

5474
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:24,800
psychedelics do you think they have

5475
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:26,160
where do you think the mind goes have

5476
03:02:24,800 --> 03:02:28,640
you done psychedelics

5477
03:02:26,160 --> 03:02:30,000
where do you think the mind goes uh is

5478
03:02:28,640 --> 03:02:32,240
there something useful to learn about

5479
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:34,399
the places it goes

5480
03:02:32,240 --> 03:02:35,439
once you come back you know i find it

5481
03:02:34,399 --> 03:02:39,040
interesting

5482
03:02:35,439 --> 03:02:40,319
that this idea that psychedelics have

5483
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:43,680
something to teach

5484
03:02:40,319 --> 03:02:44,880
is almost unique to psychedelics right

5485
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:47,760
people don't argue this about

5486
03:02:44,880 --> 03:02:49,840
amphetamines and

5487
03:02:47,760 --> 03:02:51,359
that's true and i'm not really sure why

5488
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:53,760
yeah i think

5489
03:02:51,359 --> 03:02:54,720
all of the drugs have lessons to teach i

5490
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:55,840
think there's things to learn from

5491
03:02:54,720 --> 03:02:57,040
opiates i think there's things to learn

5492
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:58,319
from amphetamines i think there's things

5493
03:02:57,040 --> 03:03:00,080
to learn from psychedelics things to

5494
03:02:58,319 --> 03:03:04,240
learn from marijuana

5495
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:06,240
um but also at the same time

5496
03:03:04,240 --> 03:03:07,520
recognize that i don't think you're

5497
03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:09,120
learning things about the world i think

5498
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:12,560
you're learning things about yourself

5499
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:15,600
yes um and you know what's the

5500
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:17,359
even though it might have even been uh

5501
03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:18,560
might have been a timothy leary quote i

5502
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:19,840
don't want to miss about him but the

5503
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:21,200
idea is basically like

5504
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:22,160
you know everybody should look behind

5505
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:23,200
the door but then once you've seen

5506
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:24,840
behind the door you don't need to keep

5507
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:27,600
going back

5508
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:29,760
um so i mean and that's my thoughts on

5509
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:33,120
on all real drug use too

5510
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:34,399
except maybe for caffeine it's a it's a

5511
03:03:33,120 --> 03:03:37,760
little experience

5512
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:38,479
that uh it's good to have but oh yeah no

5513
03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:39,920
i mean

5514
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:41,760
yeah i guess yeah psychedelics are

5515
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:43,520
definitely um

5516
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:44,800
so you're a fan of new experiences i

5517
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:46,399
suppose yes because they all

5518
03:03:44,800 --> 03:03:47,920
contain a little especially the first

5519
03:03:46,399 --> 03:03:49,600
few times it contains some lessons that

5520
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:53,040
could be picked up

5521
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:55,279
yeah and i'll i'll revisit psychedelics

5522
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:58,640
maybe once a year

5523
03:03:55,279 --> 03:03:59,840
um usually small smaller doses

5524
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:02,080
maybe they turn up the learning rate of

5525
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:04,399
your brain i've heard that

5526
03:04:02,080 --> 03:04:07,359
i like that yeah that's cool big

5527
03:04:04,399 --> 03:04:09,359
learning rates have pros and cons

5528
03:04:07,359 --> 03:04:10,479
last question this is a little weird one

5529
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:14,000
but you've called yourself

5530
03:04:10,479 --> 03:04:16,000
crazy in the past uh

5531
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:17,279
first of all on a scale of one to ten

5532
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:19,279
how crazy would you say

5533
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:20,720
are you oh i mean it depends how you you

5534
03:04:19,279 --> 03:04:23,439
know when you compare me to elon musk

5535
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:27,040
and anthony lewandowski not so crazy

5536
03:04:23,439 --> 03:04:31,520
so like like a seven let's go with six

5537
03:04:27,040 --> 03:04:33,200
six yes six what uh

5538
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:35,120
well like seven seven's a good number

5539
03:04:33,200 --> 03:04:37,760
seven sorry well yeah i'm sure

5540
03:04:35,120 --> 03:04:38,319
day by day changes right so but you're

5541
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:42,319
in that

5542
03:04:38,319 --> 03:04:43,920
in that area what uh

5543
03:04:42,319 --> 03:04:45,680
in thinking about that what do you think

5544
03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:48,880
is the role of madness

5545
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:50,000
is that a feature or a bug if you were

5546
03:04:48,880 --> 03:04:53,920
to uh dissect your

5547
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:56,960
brain so okay from like a

5548
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:58,880
like mental health lens on crazy

5549
03:04:56,960 --> 03:05:00,640
i'm not sure i really believe in that

5550
03:04:58,880 --> 03:05:03,840
i'm not sure i really believe in like

5551
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:04,560
a lot of that stuff right this concept

5552
03:05:03,840 --> 03:05:06,640
of

5553
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:07,840
okay you know when you get over to like

5554
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:09,680
like like like

5555
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:11,359
hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia these

5556
03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:13,600
things are clearly

5557
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:15,439
real somewhat biological and then over

5558
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:18,319
here on the spectrum you have like

5559
03:05:15,439 --> 03:05:18,720
a dd and oppositional defiance disorder

5560
03:05:18,319 --> 03:05:21,200
and

5561
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:23,200
these things that are like wait this is

5562
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:25,520
normal spectrum human behavior like this

5563
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:25,520
isn't

5564
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:30,319
you know where's the the line here and

5565
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:32,960
why is this like a

5566
03:05:30,319 --> 03:05:35,439
problem so there's this whole this you

5567
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:37,279
know the neurodiversity of humanity is

5568
03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:38,560
huge like people think i'm always on

5569
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:40,080
drugs people are saying this to me on my

5570
03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:41,920
streams and like guys you know like i'm

5571
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:43,840
real open with my drug use i'd tell you

5572
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:45,279
if i was on drugs

5573
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:46,880
yeah i had like a cup of coffee this

5574
03:05:45,279 --> 03:05:47,200
morning but other than that this is just

5575
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:51,439
me

5576
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:54,479
you're witnessing my brain and action

5577
03:05:51,439 --> 03:05:56,560
so so the word madness doesn't even uh

5578
03:05:54,479 --> 03:05:58,960
make sense and then you're in the rich

5579
03:05:56,560 --> 03:06:02,960
neurodiversity of

5580
03:05:58,960 --> 03:06:04,240
humans i think it makes sense but only

5581
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:07,680
for

5582
03:06:04,240 --> 03:06:07,920
like some insane extremes like if you

5583
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:12,640
are

5584
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:15,439
actually like visibly hallucinating

5585
03:06:12,640 --> 03:06:17,359
um you know that's okay but there is the

5586
03:06:15,439 --> 03:06:20,800
kind of spectrum on which you stand out

5587
03:06:17,359 --> 03:06:23,040
like that that's uh like if i were to

5588
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:24,960
look you know at decorations on a

5589
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:27,920
christmas tree or something like that

5590
03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:29,439
like if you were a decoration out that

5591
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:32,560
would catch my eye like

5592
03:06:29,439 --> 03:06:32,560
that thing is sparkly

5593
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:37,279
whatever the hell that thing is uh

5594
03:06:35,359 --> 03:06:41,120
there's something to that

5595
03:06:37,279 --> 03:06:43,840
just like refusing to be um

5596
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:46,560
boring or maybe boring is the wrong word

5597
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:46,560
but to um

5598
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:53,200
yeah i mean be willing to sparkle

5599
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:54,560
you know it's it's like somewhat

5600
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:58,399
constructed i mean

5601
03:06:54,560 --> 03:07:00,000
i am who i choose to be uh

5602
03:06:58,399 --> 03:07:03,680
i'm gonna say things as true as i can

5603
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:05,680
see them i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

5604
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:07,439
lie and but that's a really important

5605
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:08,960
feature in itself so like whatever the

5606
03:07:07,439 --> 03:07:12,640
neurodiversity of your

5607
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:15,520
whatever your brain is not putting um

5608
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:17,760
constraints on it that force it to to

5609
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:18,640
fit into the mold of what society is

5610
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:20,720
like

5611
03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:24,399
defines what you're supposed to be so

5612
03:07:20,720 --> 03:07:27,760
you're one of the specimens that

5613
03:07:24,399 --> 03:07:31,600
that doesn't mind being yourself

5614
03:07:27,760 --> 03:07:35,439
being right is super important

5615
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:35,439
except at the expense of being wrong

5616
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:40,800
without breaking that apart i think it's

5617
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:42,399
a beautiful way to end it and george

5618
03:07:40,800 --> 03:07:44,479
