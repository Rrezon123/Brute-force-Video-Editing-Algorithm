# Brute-force-Video-Editing-Algorithm

## Libraries

This program uses python libraies, which are:
-  pytube
-  moviepy

## Info 
Brute force video editing algorithm is a small piece of code that can cut your videos into sequences based on the keywords(key sentences)  you input. However, it's still unfinished because I need to train a model that detects rhetorical questions from normal ones.

The way the algorithm processes the information is not by analyzing the video because that would have been a three-dimensional problem and an easier approach is if we analyze the caption text file so we reduce the dimensionality to one.
